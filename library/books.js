    // "<heading>Prologue</heading><br>Marcus walked out of the grocery store. He carried one bag, which held just one carton of milk. He felt awkward to go to the grocery store, only to buy some milk. He strolled across the street and onto the crosswalk.<br>It just happened. There wasn't any reason for the truck to go forward. The walk light was lit and the traffic light was red for a while. But the truck rushed without a care in the world, until the driver saw Marcus.<br>\"Look out!\" he yelled.<br>One glance, and Marcus knew. He didn't even have time to brace for impact.",
    // "The front slammed into him, and for a moment pain was the only thing he could think of. The milk he bought exploded onto the floor. Lightning coursed through his body at the blink of an eye. He became totally paralyzed and could not move. The last thing he could feel was his entire self collapsing, and then everything went black.<br>Moments later, he woke up from a bright light.<br><i>I think…I died?</i> Marcus thought. He looked around, but everything was too bright for his eyes. <i>So this is heaven…</i><br>He tried standing up, but could barely even move his head.",
    // "The pain started rushing back.<br><i>Oww, owwww…</i> He lied back down, feeling to frail to move. His eyes partially regained its focus. He could make out two silhouettes, people, looming over him.<br>\"Don't try too hard to stand just yet, \" Marcus heard one of the people say. It sounded like a man. The speaker turned to the other person next to him. \"Thank goodness she's alright.\"<br><i>I must be in a hospital…</i> Marcus thought. <i>Why'd I think I died, anyway?</i><br>The person next to the man gestured towards him. \"Well, we can't just watch her,\" she said (Marcus assumed that the other person is female from their voice)."
    // "\"Let's take her to be cleaned up.\"<br><i>Whoa, whoa, whoa…</i> Marcus thought. <i>They seriously didn't assume I'm a </i>girl<i> right now…I mean, I obviously look like a </i>man,<i> don't I?!</i><br>He blinked a couple times and was able to see better. The world around him wasn't as bright as before, but on the contrary was kind of dark. He could see that the two people were actually a man and a woman, but he wore overalls and she wore a straw hat. They were pretty tall for their age. Looking behind them, there were thin metal fences enclosing the small area he was in. The floor was littered with straw or hay.",

    "All around the room, girls in pink tutus were having last-minute ballet practice. Hope stood against the handrail, amazed at how skilled all the other girls were. From across the room, three girls pointed at Hope, who was the only one with a brown tutu.<br>\"What is she even wearing?\" a black-haired girl smirked.<br>\"You're asking me?\" sniggered a girl beside her with green & blue hair, \"It looks like she got that from the dollar store!\"<br>\"Come on, that's mean,\" a blond-haired girl by them said, \"She at least spent two dollars on that thing she calls an outfit.\"<br>All three girls laughed to themselves, with Hope oblivious.<br>The ballet instructor walked up to Hope. \"Hope, what's the",
    "matter?\"<br>\"Nothing,\" she replied, \"I'm just waiting for my dad to come.\"<br>\"He will, don't worry.\"<br>\"Maybe.\"<br>\"Just work on your pointe, you need to be prepared.\"<br>\"Yes, Miss.\" Hope nodded. She began to practice and tried not to worry. A man quickly made his way towards her. \"Hey sweetie, sorry I'm late,\" he said, \"Just got caught up in something.\"<br>\"It's okay,\" Hope reassured, \"At least you're here now.\"<br>\"Here, I picked out this flower, especially for you.\" Her dad held out a white flower and tucked it under her headband. \"Here you go.\"<br>She smiled, her face blushing red like her hair. \"Aww, thank you Dad. I love you.\"",
    "\"Well, I better go back to my seat,\" her dad said. He hugged Hope tightly. \"You'll do amazing, remember I believe in you.\"<br>&#160&#160&#160&#160&#160&#160&#160&#160&#160&#160&#160&#160✿ ✿ ✿<br>The music started playing, and all the ballerinas began dancing. Every seat in the audience was full. The ballerinas danced gracefully along with the music. Hope ran across the stage and leaped. She led the others in pointe at the center. Hope's dad sat in the front row, tears of joy in his eyes. Hope twirled in the center as the ballet performance came to a close. Her dad stood up and bursted into applause.<br>&#160&#160&#160&#160&#160&#160&#160&#160&#160&#160&#160&#160✿ ✿ ✿<br>In a diner open late at night, Hope's dad was busy at work.",
    "He mopped the floor, cooked the food, and cleaned the tables.<br>\"Hello?\" a woman sitting in a booth called, \"My burger has onions in it. I specifically asked for no onions.\"<br>\"I apologize,\" Hope's dad responded, \"I'll get you a new one right away.\"<br>He sighed as he finished preparing the burger.<br>Later in the night, he checked out groceries for a customer in a supermarket. He swept the floor and cleaned the isles too.<br>\"Richard, could I talk to you in my office?\" the manager said as he came up to him.<br>\"Yes, of course.\" he replied.<br>They entered the office, and the manager sat down.",
    "\"Well, you've been coming late to work recently,\" he began, \"And you've been slacking in your work performance. What's been going on?\"<br>\"I have a daughter. I need to take care of her.\" Richard explained, \"Plus, I have another job.\"<br>\"I think you're taking on more than you can handle,\" the manager said calmly, \"So, I am with no other choice but to relieve you from this job. You've been a brilliant employee.\"<br>\"I really need the money, please dont—\"<br>\"I have no other choice. I'm sorry.\"<br>\"Thank you for the opportunity.\" He walked out of the manager's office and to a park. There, he sat down and started crying.",
    "&#160&#160&#160&#160&#160&#160&#160&#160&#160&#160&#160&#160✿ ✿ ✿<br>The next day, Hope was performing ballet at the park. Her hat was placed upside-down on the floor for donations. A blond-haired boy placed a dollar bill in her hat.<br>\"You're really talented,\" he told her, \"You know that, right?\"<br>\"Oh, thanks…\" Hope blushed.<br>\"Uh, I'm Noah.\"<br>\"Hope.\"<br>\"Pretty name.\" Noah said.<br>\"Yeah, my dad says it's special.\"<br>\"Mhm.\"<br>\"Well, nice meeting you, Noah. I have to go now…\" Hope said.<br>\"Nice meeting you too.\"<br>Hope walked away, still smiling and blushing.<br>&#160&#160&#160&#160&#160&#160&#160&#160&#160&#160&#160&#160✿ ✿ ✿<br>\"Bye Lucy,\" Hope's dad called to his coworker at the diner.",
    "\"I'll see you tomorrow.\"<br>\"See you, stay safe.\" Lucy replied. He went outside and began walking home. He looked around, feeling slighly uncomfortable. He continued, but was interrupted.<br>\"Stay where you are,\" a man behind him said. He wore a beanie and goggles, holding a gun pointed directly at Richard. Hope's dad turned around.<br>\"Look, I-I don't want any trouble,\" he told the gunman.<br>\"You aren't going to get any,\" the gunman threatened, \"As long as you give me what I want.\"<br>Tears welled up in his eyes as Hope's dad handed him a few dollar bills.<br>\"You're joking, right?\" the gunman said.",
    "\"It's all I have,\" Richard looked down at the floor, \"I work at a diner, I have a child…I don't have much…\"<br>\"Boohoo, cry me a river. There's an ATM <i>right there,</i>\" the gunman said, his gun still pointed at him, \"Take out some money or I'll put a bullet through your head.\"<br>\"I barely have any money in my account. I have <i>nothing…</i>\" he said. The gunman shoved him, but Richard punched him in the face and knocked him over. The gun fell out of his hands, and Richard quickly grabbed it. He pointed it at his attacker.<br>\"I know you won't do it,\" the gunman smirked. A gun went off loudly, but it wasn't the one Richard held. Hope's dad looked down at his chest, and fell to his knees.",
    "Another gunman stood behind him, watching Richard collapse. The two gunmen walked away, leaving him on the floor. Richard's life flashed before his eyes.<br><br>He remembered the day he met her at the park, her bright red hair, and the day he proposed to her, and when…<br>\"I'm sorry to say this but…\" the doctor told him all those years ago.<br>His memories of his wife came flooding back to him. Memories of her when she was pregnant…and her grave too. When she left this world.<br>\"…Your wife died during childbirth.\"",
    "He recalled the happy ones too, of the baby, of Hope growing up, learning how to ride a bike…All those bittersweet memories…<br><br>Lucy walked out of the diner, looking around after hearing the gunshot. Her eyes grew wide as she saw him and called for help.<br>&#160&#160&#160&#160&#160&#160&#160&#160&#160&#160&#160&#160✿ ✿ ✿<br>Back at home, Hope woke up with a strange feeling.<br>\"Dad?\" she called as she headed down stairs, \"Hmmm…I guess he's working a long shift.\"<br>Hope walked to school. During class, the intercom went off.<br>\"Hope Moore, please come to the principal's office.\"<br>Hope left and opened the door to the office. The principal sat at his desk, looking very concerned.",
    "\"Yes, sir? Why did you call me?\" Hope sat down, looking worried, \"I didn't do anything!\"<br>\"It's not about school…\" the principal said, not sure how to begin.<br>\"Then what is it?\"<br>\"Your dad…\"<br>\"Yeah, I was wondering about him, he wasn't at home—\"<br>\"Hope. Your dad is in the hospital…\"<br>\"What?! WHY?\" Hope cried, tears welling up in her eyes.<br>\"He was shot in the back. We're going to get you to the hospital now.\"<br>\"Is-is he okay?\"<br>\"We don't know yet…\" the principal told her. Hope sobbed in her hands while the principal watched her, not knowing how to comfort her.",
    "&#160&#160&#160&#160&#160&#160&#160&#160&#160&#160&#160&#160✿ ✿ ✿<br>Hope held her dad's hand as tears streaked down her cheeks. Her dad had a black eye and his arm was connected to a container of blood. A monitor beeped in the background, keeping track of his heart rate. He opened his eyes slightly.<br>\"Hope…\" her dad said. He was hit with an old memory of them.<br><br>Hope was doing homework while he washed the dishes.<br>\"Hey, Dad? Why did you name me Hope?\" she had asked.<br>\"Well,\" he responded, \"Your mom left us really early.\"<br>It had hurt him to recall the pain Hope's mom had gone through. He had fallen to his knees when he heard the doctor's unforgettable words.",
    "\"You never got to meet her, but she was the prettiest woman you'd ever see.\" Hope's dad had told her, \"I was heartbroken, but when I looked at you, I knew.\"<br>His eyes filled with tears as he washed the dishes. \"Your name is Hope, because hope is what you give me.\"<br>Hope blushed as she looked at her dad from across the room, her eyes brimming with tears.<br><br>\"Dad…?\" Hope glanced at her dad with a worried look. The monitor's beeps began to slow down. He smiled at Hope, and closed his eyes. Hope's heart dropped in her chest.<br>\"Dad…\" Tears spilled from her eyes as she gently shook his arm. \"Please…don't go…\"",
    "No response. The smile on her dad's face faded away.<br>\"No…\" Hope muttered. The sound from the monitor beeped without pausing. She collapsed in her chair, streams of tears falling endlessly.<br>&#160&#160&#160&#160&#160&#160&#160&#160&#160&#160&#160&#160✿ ✿ ✿<br>The pain in her chest never left. Hope stared at her dad's casket with the priest. She placed a white flower on top of it.<br>\"I picked out this flower, especially for you, Dad.\" Hope said, trying to choke back her tears.<br><br>Hope rolled her luggage behind her as she followed a woman outside. She led hear into a car to be driven to her new home. Hope cried as she watched her childhood fade off in the distance.",
    "The woman opened the car door and led Hope to a place called Sarah's Orphanage. When they walked inside, Hope spotted a blond-haired boy sitting in a corner. His face was buried in his knees, and when he looked up Hope saw tears running down his face. He looked painfully familiar.<br>Her eyes grew wide and tons of questions raced across her mind. \"Noah…?\"<br><br><i>Hope Vol. 2</i> coming in April 2023! (Sorry for the delay >n<)",

    "<heading><b>Introduction</b></heading><br><b><i>Nunners' Guide To Dreams & Nightmares</i> is a stupid book that shouldn't be taken seriously</b>. If you're shocked or mad about what your dreams tell about you, just know it's (probably) not true. Don't think I'm diagnosing you or anything. Anyways, the <i>things-you-see-in-your-dreams</i> are sorted in alphabetical order. Meanings created by me except for a few of them (see credits at the last page). And uh if you dreamt or had a nightmare last night don't forget to look for its meaning here.<br><br>Stay tuned for the future Insights chapter where I yap about dream theory<br><br>Well, I hope you enjoy it!<br>— Nunners",
    "<heading><b>A</b></heading><br><b>Ants</b><br>If you dreamt you were being killed/trampled by a ton of ants, it shows that you're too weak/scared to even step on an ant lol. If you were dreaming about watching ants, you probably really like ants 'cause I don't know who dreams of ants…<br><br><b>Animal</b><br><i>See Ants/Bears/Bees/Cows/<br>Giraffes/Jellyfish/Koalas/<br>Lizards/Octopi/Quails</i>",
    "<heading><b>B</b></heading><br><b>Bears</b><br>If you dreamt that a bear attacked/killed you, you probably <i>won't</i> be attacked by a bear in the future. Ah, scratch that. Everyone's gonna be mauled to death by a bear in the near future (according to <i>Bears Want To Kill You</i> by Ethan Nicole). If you've been attacked by a bear in the past, your nightmare was probably just a cute little memory of the past, don't worry about it. Yeah…<br><br><b>Bees</b><br>If you dreamt that you were being swarmed by bees, it may be a result from a bad memory from the past relating to bees.",
    "<heading><b>B</b></heading><br><b>Bees (cont.)</b><br>Same goes for dreaming about being stung by one/many. If you had a nice dream about petting cute bees, then good for you since 12.5% of all people are terrified by them. But if those bees were collecting pollen and somehow turning it into honey (instead of nectar), then stop playing Bee Swarm Simulator.<br><br><b>Burgers</b><br>If you dreamed about burgers then you're probably really obsessed with burgers. If you dream of burgers or any other junk food several more times this week, then you may develop obesity (no kidding this time). If you dreamt that someone stole your burger then oh no someone's gonna steal your burger today :C",
    "<heading><b>B</b></heading><br><b>Bulls</b><br>Bro what in the world you doin' dreaming about bulls????",
    "<heading><b>C</b></heading><br><b>Cheeseburgers</b><br><i>See Burgers</i><br><br><b>Cows</b><br>If you dreamt about cows, it could be because you ate some Chick-fil-a yesterday. If you didn't, then it probably means you really like cows for some reason. In many cultures, cows are considered sacred, so something really epic may happen to you soon. If you were dreaming that you got reincarnated as a cow, then maybe you read <i>I Got Reincarnated As A Cow</i> a bit too much. If you constantly dream of turning into a cow, then it's very likely that you <i>will</i> become one when you die. If you dreamt about male cows (called bulls get it right), then <i>see Bulls.</i>",
    "<heading><b>D</b></heading><br><b>Death</b><br>If you dreamt that you died, then you probably woke up right after (omg you did 😱). It's okay, you respawn. If you dreamt that someone you care about died, then uh oh <i>something similar might just happen</i> 👀",
    "<heading><b>E</b></heading><br><b>Egg</b><br>If you dreamt about cooked eggs, then you probably really want eggs for breakfast. Chances are, if you already ate breakfast, there weren't any eggs in it. Too bad.",
    "<heading><b>F</b></heading><br><b>Falling</b><br>If you dreamt that you were falling off a high height or into oblivion, there's probably some really big problems bugging you right now. But if you dreamt off falling off a high height on <i>purpose,</i> then…that's a different story…(<i>see Suicide</i>)",
    "<heading><b>G</b></heading><br><b>Genshin Impact</b><br>If you were dreaming about playing Genshin Impact or picturing yourself in it, then please turn off your electronic device immediately and touch grass.<br><br><b>Giraffes</b><br>If you dreamt about giraffes, your neck will grow 5% longer than normal every month starting tomorrow 🦒.",
    "<heading><b>H</b></heading><br><b>Hamburgers</b><br><i>See Burgers</i><br><br><b>Honkai Star Rail</b><br><i>See Genshin Impact</i>",
    "<heading><b>I</b></heading><br><b>Ice Cream</b><br>If you dreamt about ice cream, it shows that you look for all the sweetest things in life. I hope you didn't just eat ice cream for breakfast right now.",
    "<heading><b>J</b></heading><br><b>Jellyfish</b><br>If you dreamt about jellyfish, it shows you may look all cute on the outside, but you're actually really stingy on the inside. Or you're like Maiah and just love jellyfish.",
    "<heading><b>K</b></heading><br><b>Koalas</b><br>If you dreamt about koalas, you probably really want to go back to sleep right now. Maybe you're jealous they get to sleep so much and you're just here trying to stay awake.",
    "<heading><b>L</b></heading><br><b>Lizards</b><br>If you dreamt lizards, then there's probably lizards in your backyard right now. If you don't have a backyard, then you probably enjoy watching lizards skitter across sidewalks or something. Or they're being annoying pests where you frequently go to. If none of these apply to you, then you're probably just dying to see a lizard in-person.",
    "<heading><b>M</b></heading><br><b>Mad</b><br>If you dreamt about being mad at someone/some people you know (a friend, someone who lives with you), then you probably had an argument or fight recently (bro no way 😱). From the looks of it, the argument didn't end well because one person may have just stormed off or hurt someone (could be you). The best thing you and the people involved should do is ✨✨make up✨✨ and ✨✨apologize✨✨.",
    "<heading><b>N</b></heading><br><b>Net</b><br>If you dreamt about being caught in a net, it probably shows that you're tangled up in a problem that's been bothering you lately. If you were dreaming that you used a net to capture something, it shows that you like taking advantage of others, even if you may not realize it. Unless you trap animals for a living or something, and you were just doing so in your sleep. Otherwise, now's a good time to stop trapping animals for your Serenitea Pot.",
    "<heading><b>O</b></heading><br><b>Octopi</b><br>If you dreamt about octopi (NOT OCTOPUSES), maybe it's 'cause you saw/ate some recently. Like, you went to Sea World on the weekend or ate Takoyaki yesterday. But if you didn't, it shows that sometimes you just wanna camouflage with your surroundings or really want eight arms. I don't really think that's a problem, but if none of these apply to you then…you have a secret liking for octopi (that you may or may not realize) 🐙",
    "<heading><b>P</b></heading><br><b>Penguins</b><br>If you dreamt about penguins, then you have some crazy obsession over them (yeah <i>anton</i>). But if you're clearly aware that you do <i>not</i> have some crazy obsession over penguins, then this shows that you like the cold or waddle when you walk lol.",
    "<heading><b>Q</b></heading><br><b>Quails</b><br>If you dreamt about quails, then it shows you're a social person. Chances are, you're also shorter than the average person your age. You also groom yourself frequently. But maybe not many people know about your true personality. You could probably shoot lazers out of your hairline or something. If you dreamt about your <i>pet</i> quail (if any), then you dreamt about it 'cause it's your pet duhh. Otherwise, you really want a pet quail and dreamt of petting it or something.",
    "<heading><b>R</b></heading><br><b>Running</b><br>If you dreamt about running, then it shows you like running (no way?!) or you're in a sport involving running. If you were running in your dream without reason and you know you hate running, you probably ran a lot or for a long distance recently. If you dreamt of running away from someone like a bad guy, then it shows you're always trying to avoid or forget your problems (especially big ones if any). So then you should <b>stop</b> avoiding them and be present. Resolve them, it's never too late to do so 😃👍!! (unless you forgot to turn in your homework and your teacher does not accept late work)",
    "<heading><b>R</b></heading><br><b>Running (cont.)</b><br>If you dreamt that you were running away (from home, the police etc.) then it shows that <i>something happened</i> in real life that lead to this (omg no way 🤯). If you were dreaming that you ran away from home, then maybe your parents aren't being parent-ly irl…or maybe just in the dream. It's like that sometimes. If you were dreaming that you were running away from the cops, then you probably commited a crime in the dream (or in real life…). If you're completely innocent (irl), then maybe you have that devious side to you that had only been brought out in a dream (just a thought).",
    "<heading><b>S</b></heading><br><b>Suicide</b><br>If you dreamt that you commit suicide, then you should attend some suicide counseling, I don't really know what to tell you—But if you were dreaming that someone you know/care about did, then uhhhh maybe tell them that you're there for them…? You may be forseeing the future or reading their thoughts somehow. 👀",
    "<heading><b>T</b></heading><br><b>Teeth</b><br>If you dreamt that a tooth fell out, then one of your teeth will most likely come out soon (if you still got baby teeth). If one/all of your teeth came out in your dream and you have all permanent teeth, then you're probably gonna lose something soon (it probably won't be just teeth).",
    "<heading><b>U</b></heading><br><b>Umbrellas</b><br>If you dreamt about umbrellas, then you probably used one recently (for blocking rain or heat). If you didn't, then maybe you or someone else bought you a new umbrella recently. The umbrella must've been really fascinating for you to dream about it, huh?",
    "<heading><b>V</b></heading><br><b>Vases</b><br>If you dreamt about vases, then you probably like buying flower bouquets and stuffing them in vases filled with water (sorry I made it sound bad). Maybe yesterday was Valentine's or Mother's Day, and you or someone else living with you got a flower bouquet and \"vased\" it. You probably sniffed or examined the flowers for long enough to dream about them. Or it's someone's wedding anniversary or baby shower and you were in charge of adding the centerpieces.",
    "<heading><b>W</b></heading><br><b>Whales</b><br>If you dreamt about whales, then you probably had a presentation at school on whales. But you probably didn't. If you dreamt of whales, you were most likely amazed at them giants at like Sea World or researched them for fun.",
    "<heading><b>X</b></heading><br><b>Xylophones</b><br>If you dreamt about xylophones (coming soon)",
    "<heading><b>Y</b></heading><br><b>Yelling</b><br>If you dreamt about yelling (coming soon)",
    "<heading><b>Z</b></heading><br><b>Zebras</b><br>If you dreamt about zebras (coming soon)",

    "Years before, Hope stood with her dad at her mother's gravestone. Her grave was next to a beautiful water fountain. She placed a fresh bouquet of white roses in front of it. After some time of mourning, they walked down the path towards the exit of the graveyard.<br>Hope held her dad's hand. \"What color was her hair?\"<br>\"Red, just like yours,\" he responded.<br>\"I wish I could have met her…\"<br>\"I wish you could have too,\" her dad sighed. \"She was just like you, you know. She wanted to be a ballerina too, professionally.\"<br>\"But why didn't she?\"",
    "\"Well, she gave that all up for you,\" he smiled. \"She had plans to go back to college and so did I.\"<br>\"Daddy,\" Hope looked down at the ground.<br>\"What's wrong?\"<br>\"Did I kill her, Daddy?\" Hope looked at her dad, eyes full of tears.<br>\"Oh my gosh, of course not.\" He hugged her as she sobbed into his arms.<br><br>&#160&#160&#160&#160&#160&#160&#160&#160&#160&#160&#160&#160✿ ✿ ✿<br><br>The memories in Hope's heart were still so vivid. The endless ring of the monitor next to her dad's hospital bed. The white flower she placed on top of his coffin. Her dad giving her the white flower before her recital.",
    "The time she walked with him when she was little, and the time she rode a bike for the first time. The last hug he ever gave her before saying goodbye. Her dad applauding for her after the performance. And the ride to the orphanage.<br><br>In a bathroom stall, Hope was panicking, breathing heavily. Noah walked in.<br>\"Hope? Everyone's looking for you,\" Noah said.<br>\"I-I can't do this…\" Hope told him, tears already forming in her eyes.<br>\"Of course you can. You've been practicing for weeks.\" He tried cheering her up.<br>\"No, I can't.\" She looked down at the floor of the stall. \"Not without my dad…\"",
    "Noah sighed and leaned his arm against Hope's stall. \"I know how you feel, trust me.\"<br>Hope's breathing suddenly became heavy and uneven. She looked up at Noah who stood in front of the door. \"I-I think I'm having a panic attack—\"<br>\"Oh—uhhh…t-try breathing slowly,\" Noah suggested.<br>\"I'm trying, it's not working—\"<br>\"Then, try counting to ten with me. I'll help you.\" he reassured. \"Okay, one…\"<br>\"Two…\"<br>\"Three…\"<br><br>Hope performs a pirouette, comepletely calm. Noah sat at the front of the audience and blushed at how talented she was. Hope looked at him and blushed too.",
    "&#160&#160&#160&#160&#160&#160&#160&#160&#160&#160&#160&#160✿ ✿ ✿<br><br>Late in the evening in Sarah's Orphanage, kids were watching TV, eating dinner, and playing outside in the backyard. Outside, Hope sat with Noah on one of the tall structures.<br>\"You were really good earlier!\" Noah smiled.<br>\"Thanks,\" she replied.<br>Noah looked at the ground below with a frown. Hope was quick to notice his feelings.<br>\"Hey, what's wrong?\"<br>\"Oh, nothing. I was just…thinking.\"<br>\"You don't need to lie.\" Hope smiled at him. \"I'm here for you.\"<br>Hope took his hand and Noah looked up at her. \"…Always\" she added.",
    "\"…I-I—\" he stammered. \"I was thinking about my dad.\"<br>Hope remembered they were in an orphanage. \"What was he like?\"<br>\"Well…that's the thing,\" Noah said. \"I…don't know. I never met him.\"<br>Noah winced at the thought. \"They said he dumped me here in a wooden basket. Moses style, with a note.\"<br>\"Wait…what happened to the note?\"<br>\"I have it here. They gave it to me a few months ago when I turned 15.\"<br>\"I don't know if it's too personal to ask, but could I see it?\" Hope asked.<br>\"Yeah…sure.\" Noah searched through his pockets and pulled out a small piece of paper. It read, \"<i>Do not try to find me…Noah is better off without me.</i>\"",
    "\"Noah…\" Hope began. \"I only came here a few months ago. Is this why you were so upset?\"<br>\"I…\" Tears welled up in his eyes. \"I just get sad sometimes, you know? When I have football practice, I look at the crowd to see if someone is holding a sign for me, someone cheering me on, someone that loves me…\"<br>He paused. \"I see no one.<br>\"Parent-teacher conferences come along, and I come with my freaking social worker while everyone's with their mom and dad.\"<br>A tear rolled down his cheek. \"I'm sorry…I just…\"<br>\"No, let it out,\" Hope told him. Noah closed his eyes.<br>\"Sometimes it just hits me. I…I have no one. Nobody…\"",
    "Hope gave him a reassuring hug and he began to cry. \"You have me,\" she said. Noah didn't say anything and sobbed in her arms.<br><br>&#160&#160&#160&#160&#160&#160&#160&#160&#160&#160&#160&#160✿ ✿ ✿<br><br>The next day, Hope held her textbooks in her arms through the school entrance. Suddenly, a familiar black-haired girl and her friends walked up to her.<br>\"Hah, look which freak decided to come to our school.\"<br>She quickly poured water on the floor in front of her. Hope didn't even have time to realize what was going on before she slipped.<br>\"Oops…sorry,\" the girl said, looking down at her. The three of them laughed.<br>\"I-It's okay…\" Hope said.",
    "She walked away ashamed as the girls continued to laugh at her.<br>\"Annie?\" the blond-haired one called towards Hope. Hope turned towards her with her head still down. The girls became amused.<br>\"Annie, is that you?\" she called again.<br>\"No, my name is Hope…\" she said.<br>\"No, I mean Annie, from the movie? The orphan?\" the girl smirked. \"You know her right?\"<br>\"I-I…\" Hope tried holding back the tears forming in her eyes, but she couldn't. She ran off crying, the three bullies laughing wildly.<br><br>Later at lunchtime, Hope looked around to find a seat. A shaggy-haired boy sitting in one of the tables looked over at her.<br>\"Is that her?\" he sneered.",
    "The mean girls from earlier sat nearby.<br>\"Yep,\" said the leader.<br>\"I'll be right back,\" he stood up. The bullies watched with a cold grin.<br>Hope looked at them in confusion. The boy walked up to Hope and slammed her food out of her hands.<br>\"Oops, my bad, haha,\" he looked down at the ruined food on the floor.<br>Hope bent down to pick it back up when he stepped all over it before she had the chance. She looked up sadly at the boy, tears already emerging. Hope only had a few seconds to see Noah running towards them and punching the boy.<br>\"Do you think you're funny?\" he glared at him.",
    "Blood oozed out from his nose because of the impact. The shaggy-haired kid just laughed at him. In the blink of an eye, he shoved Noah to the ground and started kicking his face. All the other students in the cafeteria gaped at the two boys fighting.<br>The principal stormed in. \"Both of you to the nurse's office now!\" he yelled. \"And make sure you pay my office a visit once you're done!\"<br><br>&#160&#160&#160&#160&#160&#160&#160&#160&#160&#160&#160&#160✿ ✿ ✿<br><br>Hope held an ice pack against Noah's head. He was still in bad shape after the fight, with a black eye and bruises.<br>\"You didn't have to do that, you know.\" Hope sighed at the condition of his face.",
    "\"I did,\" Noah said. \"I couldn't stand you being treated like that.\"<br>A tear fell down Hope's eye.<br>\"Why are you crying?\" he asked worriedly.<br>\"I've just never had someone care for me like you do, since…\" Hope's face turned red. \"Well, you know…\"<br>Noah smiled. \"Well, I—\"<br>Hope leaned forward and kissed him.<br><br>&#160&#160&#160&#160&#160&#160&#160&#160&#160&#160&#160&#160✿ ✿ ✿<br><br>The next day, Hope sat at a policeman's desk. Her social worker sat at one end of the room.<br>\"Hope, we have disappointing news about the investigation of you father,\" the policeman said with a concerned look.",
    "\"W-What is it?\" Hope said anxiously.<br>\"Well…\"<br>\"TELL ME. Don't sugarcoat it.\"<br>\"The surveillance cameras on that street were broken, as the street was so run-down. Therefore, we cannot find enough evidence to rule your father's death as a murder.\"<br>\"What?\" she looked at him like he was crazy.<br>He continued. \"The wounds appear to be self-inflicted—\"<br>\"What abount the blood?\" Hope said in a panic. \"The witness? <i>Anything?!</i>\"<br>\"According to the breathalyzer, the witness had been drinking that night, so they're an invalid witness.\"<br>The policeman took a deep breath.",
    "\"I'm sorry to say this, but we've come to the conclusion…that your father killed himself.\"<br>\"No…no…\" Hope couldn't bear what she was hearing.<br>\"I'm very sorry, you have my condolences. It may be hard to accept—\"<br>\"It can't be…\" she looked up at the policeman.<br>\"We have a helpline ready for you to call if you're feeling—\"<br>Hope put her fists down on his desk. \"NO! My father didn't kill himself.\"<br>She stared at him defiantly. \"He worked and he worked to support us, to support <i>me.</i> He would come home late after a shift and still use whatever little energy he had left to cook me dinner.\"<br>A tear ran down her face.",
    "\"He gave <i>everything</i> for me. He would <i>NEVER</i> kill himself.\" She took off, leaving the policeman feeling guilty.<br>\"Hope, wait!\" her social worker stood up hurriedly.<br><br>Hope sat curled up by a bush in the park. Her eyes were still wet from crying. She reminisced a time her dad had placed a bandage on her knee when she scraped it during ballet.<br>\"Never give up in what you believe in,\" he told her then. \"Remember that, okay?\"<br>\"I will,\" she responded. Hope remembered that she had cried when she had gotten injured, and that it was her dad who cheered her up.<br>She had a determined look on her face.",
    "\"I will get my dad justice,\" she stated.<br>Hope walked down the street near the diner her dad used to work at. It was late at night, so it looked abandoned. She turned and pictured her dad on the ground there with tears in his eyes. Before she knew it, someone appeared in front of her.<br>\"Oh, sweetie,\" said a man dressed in all black. He wore a beanie and goggles and his voice sounded cold and sarcastic.<br>\"You shouldn't be on these streets this late at night.\"<br>Hope didn't say anything and did not take her eyes off the object he held. It was a gun.<br>\"You did it…didn't you?\" Hope murmured, trying to keep the fear out of her voice.",
    "\"Did what?\" the gunman asked, acting as if he had no clue.<br>\"You killed my father…\" Hope began to get irritated at him.<br>\"I don't know what you're talking about, sweetie.\" he replied in an annoying voice.<br>Hope couldn't contain it anymore. \"STOP CALLING ME THAT!\" she screamed in his face.<br>The man took off his goggles and his face was tense. He pointed his gun at her.<br>\"You might want to reduce your volume,\" the gunman said heatedly. \"Or things are gonna get really bloody.\"<br>He tilted his head a little and smiled bitterly. \"You wouldn't want that, do you, <i>sweetie?</i>\"<br>\"I said <i>STOP!!</i>\" Hope yelled, infuriated.<br>Suddenly, he fired at her.",
    "Hope braced for impact just as someone jumped in front of her. Hope fell down to her knees in tears to see Noah on the ground, who had saved her life. Tears streaked down Noah's face, which never fully healed yet. The bullet had hit him directly in the chest and he was bleeding badly.<br>\"NO!\" she panicked. She held him in her arms and could not do anything.<br>All of a sudden there was a clatter of a gun falling on the floor. The gunman's eyes were wide and fear was visible in him.<br>\"Noah?\"<br>He clearly remembered the time he surrendered Noah in a basket to the orphanage. He placed a teddy bear, baby bottle, and a note to the caretakers inside.",
    "He fought back the tears, but it was for the best…<br>Noah looked up at the gunman weakly.<br>\"D-Dad?\"<br><br><i>Hope Vol. 3</i> coming in June 2023!",

    "The nurses quickly escorted Noah to the surgery room in the hospital. Hope followed behind them.<br><i>There are times in life when you're tested,</i> she thought, <i>When you feel like the world is out to get you.<br>She looked at Noah with the bullet hole in his chest.<br><i>…And you feel like there's nothing you can possibly do.

    "I was still half asleep when my dad shook me awake at 5 am.<br>\"C'mon, Eve, wake up! We're gonna hike up the trail without you!\"<br>I groaned. It was clearly still dark outside. \"It's so early…Do we <i>have</i> to?\"<br>\"Of course!\" He leaned closer to me as if to tell me a secret. \"And besides, you already know Sarah's been dying to see the view. Let's go!\"<br>He waited outside. Not this about Sarah again. She's Dad's girlfriend, and this trip was meant to be a \"bonding experience\" for us. I changed clothes against my will and got out of the tent. My stomach grumbled. Dad said we would be eating breakfast during the hike. But I wanted food <i>now</i>…",
    "I could see the \"Silver Woods Main Trail\" sign ahead and Sarah waving at me. Literally all the other campers were still asleep in their tents. I was close to freezing <i>and</i> starving to death, so I ignored her and tried to keep warm. Dad must've noticed because he gestured me towards her.<br>\"Hey, don't be rude, Evie.\" I glanced at him when he said that. He never called me that, not since Mom died… \"She's got a gift for you. Go say hi.\"<br>I walked towards her. Sarah looked nothing like Mom, with short, black hair and an excited grin all the time. Mom had dirty-blond hair like mine and was always calm.<br>\"Hey, Eve!\"",
    "\"Can I see the gift Dad mentioned?\" I walked ahead of her impatiently. The path was already getting uneven. <i>I hope she trips,</i> I thought. I realized that the idea seemed to be going overboard. I shook it away. Her gift better be a hot stack of pancakes.<br>\"Here,\" Sarah caught up with me and wrapped something around my neck. \"Ooh, it fits!\"<br>\"Hey, what're you—!\" It was a light brown scarf. Surprisingly, it was cozy, but I tried to look like I didn't care.<br>\"It bring out your eyes.\" She smiled at me.<br>\"Sure, whatever.\"<br>We started to walk. I could hear Dad trying to catch up from behind.",
    "Sarah had one of those moments when she remembered something big.<br>I didn't really want to engage in a conversation with her, but she just started talking.<br>\"Hey, have you heard? It's rumored that this forest has a secret grove somewhere far away.\" My curiosity got the best of me. Sure, the rumor sounded stupid, but I looked up at her in spite of myself.<br>\"It's called Charcoal Grove. Legend has it that phoenixes once lived there. Apparently, they've all disappeared.\"<br>The surrounding trees were looming over us. Their branches shook in the breeze. From below, the trees looked like giant skeletons in the darkness.",
    "The path was only visible from the steak lights beside the fences. I wondered if Dad brought a flashlight, but then I totally forgot that I could use my phone's. My pockets were empty. I guess I left it back at the tent.<br>\"Every last one of them?\" I asked Sarah. She shrugged.<br>\"Who knows? But, if you do see one, could you take a photo of it for me?\"<br>\"Yeah, maybe.\"<br>She grinned at me and left to walk with Dad. She really was different from Mom, considering how much she smiled. I looked back at her. Dad was talking with Sarah, and she laughed and clutched onto his arm. I quickly turned away from them and angered boiled inside of me.",
    "<i>How could Dad be so happy with her?</i> I kicked at a rock like a soccer ball to keep me occupied. Mom couldn't be replaced. It started to get even colder, so I wrapped the scarf around me tighter when Sarah wasn't looking. But I couldn't just tell him to stop liking her. That wasn't how it worked.<br>I didn't speak at all as we continued the trail. It was like it got steeper with every step I took. Looking up, the sun must've started to rise a little. The trail wound up to the top of a mountain. I tried to eavesdrop on Dad and his girlfriend, but then I accidentally kicked the rock over the fence. It fell far and disappeared in the field of trees below. It was as if the trees weren't affected from the impact.",
    "I guess no matter how much I convinced Dad, he wouldn't break up with Sarah. When we reached the top, I sat on a bench and regained my breath. Dad's girlfriend went close to the edge and was in total awe. It really was a stunning view from the top. The sun was rising and it painted the sky with orange hues. The hike must've taken more than an hour, because I was <i>really</i> tired.<br>\"Need a drink?\" Dad plopped down beside me. He handed me his water flask and I was about to chug the whole thing if he hadn't stopped me. He also gave me his sandwich. I was so caught up in my thoughts that I must've forgotten mine. I took a bite but I forgot my hunger. I re-wrapped and pocketed the sandwich.",
    "I stood up and walked towards the lookout. Looking down over the fence, the forest rolled for miles over hills and mountains. Sarah was taking a hundred photos in all sorts of angles, some including herself.<br>\"Want to take a photo with me?\" she flipped her phone camera around so that it faced the two of us.<br>\"Ehh, I'm not into that kinda stuff…\" I cringed slightly and walked away. Dad suddenly jogged up to me like he was gonna pee his pants.<br>\"Hey, uhh Eve, could you do me a favor?\" He eyed Sarah quickly. Whatever this \"favor\" was, there was a 99% chance this was going to involve <i>her.</i>",
    "\"I…totally forgot to take photos of the trees on the way here. Here, can you take some for me?\"<br>Dad handed me his phone like he was in a hurry. He pushed me a little. \"Oh, and, can you get pictures of the view of the trees back there? Thanks.\"<br><i>What was <i>that</i> all about?</i> I thought, heading back towards the trail. I opened the camera on his phone and took a couple photos that showed the trees plus the pretty sky. I walked a little more to get the pics Dad specifically asked me to get. They literally looked just like the photos I took earlier. Why did he make me take a <i>walk</i> then? I lost my train of thought when a squirrel appeared from behind a bush. It stared directly at me, then towards the lookout.",
    "Just to be funny, I recorded it. It held its gaze for so long, I had an idea about catching it. I decided to turn around to see what the little guy had been so captivated at. From the distance, I could see the silhouette of Dad, who was unusually close to Sarah. I heard the squirrel scamper away. I moved in closer and hid behind a tree, peeking out.<br><i>Oh no. Ohhhhh no.</i> I could see him reaching for something in his pocket. <i>No…th—there's no way—</i> He suddenly got on one knee and proposed to her. It was obvious. Sarah's hands covered her mouth. The ring was glittering in the morning sun. I wanted to run over there and break up what was going on, but I was too late.",
    "I bet she said \"yes\" because Dad slid the ring on her finger and th—they—(I'm not gonna say the word, I don't want to)<br>I was totally furious from being tricked. Of course Dad would find some excuse to get me to leave for this, especially since I didn't like Sarah. This woman can't replace Mom…no, never. I deleted all the photos I took including the squirrel video. But I could only stare at them helplessly.<br>\"Sarah's going to be your mom soon.\" I nearly jumped from the sight of Dad and his new fiancé. I probably started staring off into space. Sarah showed me her engagement ring as if I wasn't watching the whole thing.",
    "\"Oh yeah. Here's your phone, Dad.\" I handed it back to him and the two of them began to head back. Dad looked at me like he was a little irritated. I was afraid of how my life would be different now. But I didn't have a choice and had to follow them.<br><br>&#160&#160&#160&#160&#160&#160&#160&#160&#160&#160&#160&#160〜 🏹 〜<br><br>I didn't talk for a while on our way back. I mostly glared at Dad from behind, who had his arm around Sarah. No way I'm calling her \"mom.\" After a while I couldn't take it anymore.<br>I ran up to Dad and tapped him on the shoulder. \"Are you sure you're making the right decision?\"",
    "He looked at me like I was insane. \"Of course.\" He must've remembered that Sarah was right next to him. \"I love Sarah. Don't you?\"<br>I managed to stifle a laugh. \"You're joking, right?\"<br>Sarah gasped. Dad looked at me seriously. \"Eve Sheryl Clark, you take that back <i>right now!</i>\"<br>\"NO!\" I took a couple steps back. \"You…You can't just replace Mom like that—\"<br>\"That's not what I meant,\" Dad said sternly. He looked at Sarah. \"I'm sorry about that, please don't listen to her.\"<br>\"It's alright,\" she looked at me empathetically and placed her hand on my shoulder. I couldn't hold it in. I tore her hand away from me. \"Don't touch me!\"",
    "Maybe I did seem insane. I glared at Dad. \"How could you forget about Mom?\" I choked back tears. It felt hard to swallow. \"Just because Mom died doesn't mean—\"<br>\"Don't you dare talk about that!\" Dad looked like he was gonna strangle me.<br>\"Why? Are you afraid of Mom's death? She died from cancer when I was five.\" I sounded grave. My vision got all watery.<br>\"Eve! You get over here right—!\"<br>Sarah grabbed my hand gently. \"Evie…\"<br>I gave her a horrified look. \"No one calls me Evie, nobody but Mom…\"<br>I suddenly bolted. I could hear them running after me. Dad yelled something, but I was too far away to understand.",
    "I didn't know where I was going. I just kept running. The wind whistled in my ears. The sound of their footsteps disappeared as I ran downhill. Other hikers stared at me when I passed them.<br>My life flashed through my eyes. I remembered Mom's calm smile and soothing voice. That one time we went to the park with Dad. That other time when we all went camping for the first time. Even the time Dad cried for the first time when he was told the news about Mom's cancer. I recalled having no friends at school, even now. After holding back tears of anger and sadness for so long, they were finally able to escape.<br>At one point I started to slow down. It dawned on me that the path was totally gone. I stopped and looked around.",
    "I only heard the song of crickets and the water of a nearby brook. The sun was fully out. I must've ran so far that I didn't know where I ended up in. I had no idea what was in store for me.",

    "I was totally beat. That run was exhausting. Besides that, I had no idea where I even was. I decided to sit against a tree to rest for a little while. I unwrapped my sandwich and took in my surroundings. To my right was a small brook, trickling softly. To my left were bushes dotted with berries. For some reason, I felt strange, being in the middle of all this. I only managed one bite from my sandwich before I almost choked.<br>I don't know how I didn't notice it at first. The grass, the plants, the trees…they were all burnt. Not fully, but charred on all sides like someone used a blowtorch too close to them. The weird thing is, all of the plants still looked alive. Then it hit me—this place sounded familiar.",

Standing on top of a platform next to a huge treehouse (when did <i>that</i> get there?), a boy pointed a loaded bow towards me. He wore a dark gray sweatshirt with the sleeves partially torn, old jeans, and shoes that were probably once white but were caked in mud. His hair was black and messy, the ends fading to blond like it got burnt. And the best thing was, he looked pretty serious about firing an arrow at me. Just my luck.<br>\"Umm, <i>what?</i>\" I managed.<br>Suddenly, he lowered his bow and his expression softened. \"Rose?\"",
    "He said it like I was his long lost twin or something. The guy climbed down from the treehouse and stepped towards where I sat. I eyed him uneasily. I didn't even know this kid, plus he looked a little older than me. No way he was my twin. The strange guy shook his head.<br>\"No, never mind. It can't be…\" He glanced at me. \"Sorry, I didn't mean to threaten you. Guess you're not dangerous.\"<br>I wanted to point out his really obvious weapon, but I stopped myself. \"So, uhh, who exactly <i>are you?</i>\"<br>\"I'm Cole,\" he said, \"I'm the guardian of the phoenix.\"<br>I stifled a laugh. \"Yeah, right,\" I said sarcastically, looking around.",
    "Sarah said that all the phoenixes died out (just mentioning her name annoys me). And this guy looked nothing like a \"guardian\".<br>\"Like I <i>really am</i> in Charcoal Grove. Even though I haven't seen a single phoeni—\"<br><i>WHOOSH.</i> As if on cue, I was hit with a huge gust of hot wind like a fireball just past by. Well, I actually <i>saw</i> a fireball come by. It wove around the tree trunks, and spread its wings. Out of nowhere, it took the form of a giant bird, its wings blazing with red-hot fire. My jaw dropped; It was so majestic, I couldn't say anything. <i>W-W-What?! I—HUH?!</i> The bird swooped down and landed gracefully beside Cole. Was it just me, or was the phoenix holding something in its beak?",
    "Cole smirked. \"Nice one, Phoebe.\" The bird handed him a piece of the thing. He took it and managed a bite.<br>\"Mmm—!\" He spat on the ground and muttered something about mayo.<br>I was too stunned to realize what had happened. Looking down, the sandwich I was just holding disappeared.<br>\"H-Hey, that's mine!\"<br>Cole wiped his mouth. \"You should've told me what was in this thing. Uhh, you want it back?\"<br>I looked at him with disgust. \"No way.\"<br>\"Alright.\" He tossed the partially-eaten sandwich to the phoenix, who immediately gobbled it up. \"I suggest you leave, uhh, whatever-your-name-is.\"<br>",
    "\"Eve,\" I said. \"But why? I just ran like a mile.\"<br>\"'Cause it's…umm, not safe.\"<br>\"Sounds like you're lying. You live here, don't you? Are you just trying to get me to leave your camp?\"<br>\"I have to protect Phoebe,\" Cole gestured towards the phoenix (<i>Phoebe the phoenix. Really?</i>). \"I gotta keep her safe from—uhh, doesn't matter.\"<br>\"Mhm, and you're sure you're not some creepy kid living in the middle of a forest?\"<br>Cole blinked, stuffing his hands in his sweater pocket. He turned and started to head back up the treehouse.<br>\"Bye…\" He said, dejectedly.<br>\"Ah—wait!\" I called, \"I didn't mean to say it like that—!\"<br>",
    "He climbed up the ladder into the treehouse. I decided to follow him. The outside was impressive enough; Large planks on top served as a roof, the walls pretty straight like it was done by a professional. There was a doorframe next to the entrance hole I came up from. I walked through it.<br>The inside was shocking too, because it was like Cole actually <i>lived</i> in there. It must have be true since the walls looked worn and scorched black. Tree branches penetrated the walls. A large hammock swung in one corner, with what looked like a deformed backpack on the floor below it. A row of bows—maybe spares—hung on a branch to the hammock's left, a large supply of arrows nearby.",
    "On the right, two logs stood in a corner like a table and chair. Resting on the table was a beautiful wood carving of a phoenix. I wondered if he whittled that. <i>There's no way…</i> I looked at Cole. He lay on the hammock as if it was his bed, staring at the ceiling.<br>\"So, did you make all of this?\" I asked.<br>\"With the help of Phoebe, yeah. She taught me everything—How to build the house, the materials, even uhh, archery.\"<br>\"Uh, right.\" <i>How in the world could a phoenix help make a treehouse?</i> I wasn't sure if I wanted to know.<br>Phoebe flew in through the door and perched on a huge branch. Weirdly, the bark didn't catch on fire.",
    "Neither did the treehouse walls. I remembered the rumors said phoenixes could control what became lit from their flames.<br>Cole sat up in his hammock. He narrowed his eyes at me. \"Are you just gonna stand there…?\"<br>\"Hey, do you ever get visitors here?\" I blurted.<br>\"Ah—y-yeah, a lot,\" Cole laughed nervously. \"Mostly birds…a couple times squirrels would come in by mistake too, heh. No humans, if you were wondering.\"<br><i>I'm the </i>first one<i>?</i> I started to feel bad for this guy. I thought about what had happened this morning. Going back wouldn't be such a good idea, not after what I said. I was still kind of surprised that Cole maintained his sanity, living out in the wild and all that.",
    "<i>Maybe he just needs company…</i><br>\"Could I stay here?\" I asked suddenly.<br>\"Huh?!\" Cole looked at me like I was crazy. \"But this place is, uhh, really shabby and—\"<br>\"Just one night. Please?\"<br>\"Uh—\" He glanced at Phoebe as if to telepathically negotiate. I think they actually <i>did,</i> because after a little bit he said, \"If you insist…\"<br>I grinned out of spite. Out of nowhere, my stomach growled madly. He probably noticed, because he added, \"You gotta find your own food though.\"<br>My smile dropped. \"Whaa—?!\"<br>\"I'm kidding.\" Cole stood and picked up his bow. After stuffing a couple arrows in his quiver, he slung it over his shoulder and stopped by the doorway.",
    "\"Just don't touch my stuff. And you need help with the hunt. I've only been gathering enough food for two, you know.\"<br>\"The hunt…\" I assumed it involved killing animals. But I had no experience in catching rabbits or fish. \"Are you gonna teach me how to do archery?\"<br>\"Of course.\" He tossed me a bow. \"Go get some arrows and meet me down below. Come on, Phoebe.\"<br>The phoenix flew down from her perch, wings so close to the walls I thought they might catch on fire. I started to wonder if this really was a good idea. Seeing a real phoenix up close was something I only dreamed of; What if she was more dangerous than I thought?<br><i>It won't be so bad,</i> I chided myself.",
    "As I grabbed some arrows, I noticed a smaller pile beside it, except with strange glowing feathers attached. <i>I'll ask about that later.</i> Turning, I spotted something even weirder: a white paper thing sticking out of that misshapen bag. I was about to go check it out, but I imagined Cole would probably get mad at me for snooping around his stuff.<br>\"Hey, you coming?\" I heard him calling from below.<br>\"Yeah…\" I took my things and hurried down. <i>I wonder how this goes…</i><br><br>&#160&#160&#160&#160&#160&#160&#160&#160&#160&#160&#160&#160〜 🏹 〜<br><br>\"I'm trying, I'm <i>trying!!</i>\" I said, nocking another arrow. I've been trying to do \"archery\" for the past fifteen minutes, with",
    "no luck. The target was supposed to be a tree several feet ahead. My best shot? An arrow that flew two feet away from me before flopping depressingly. My recent fails were even more disappointing, as if the arrows lost interest in flying.<br>\"You're unbelievable,\" Cole sighed, \"How do you somehow shoot the arrow <i>backwards?!</i>\"<br>\"I said I'm trying! Can't you blame the arrows instead?\"<br>\"I make all of my arrows perfectly,\" he insisted. I almost laughed. If <i>those</i> were considered perfect, then I was a squirrel. The arrows still resembled uneven sticks.<br>\"Okay, okay. Get into proper stance before nocking the arrow.\" His instructions were very repetitive.",
    "\"Hold the bow steady. Now pull it back.\"<br>I glanced at the quiver Cole made for me. He asked if it was okay to use my scarf, and I let him. I mean, maybe it would teach Sarah a lesson or something. It felt good watching him tear the gift apart.<br>\"Why are you speaking like you taught someone how to do this before?\" I asked.<br>\"Well, because I did. I took archery class before…\" He had one of those faraway looks, like he was feeling nostalgic. \"And one of my friends there kept messing up. So I had to constantly reteach her.\"<br>I eyed him suspiciously. \"Didn't you tell me <i>Phoebe</i> was the one who taught you archery?\"<br>",
    "His eyes darted. \"Uh, well—Get your head in the game, okay?\"<br>\"Fine.\" I pulled the bowstring back. The arrow stayed in place. The look on Cole's face told me I did it correctly after five years.<br>\"Alright, now <i>aim.</i> Don't lose your grip…\" He watched my every movement carefully, which didn't help. \"Okay…<i>fire!</i>\"<br>My arrow sailed forward. I guess I wasn't expecting it to lurch towards the ground, because I felt like giving up. It landed just before the tree's roots.<br>\"Man, you were really close,\" Cole told me, \"But you gotta try harder if you want lunch. And we're having fish, by the way\"<br>He went over to the brook and started to shoot the fish. I was ready to snap my bow in half.",
    "Reluctantly, I walked over to the tree to pick up the arrow. Nocking another arrow, I aimed once more. I took a deep breath, but I almost collapsed over exhaustion (kind of an exaggeration though). It was because the delicious smell of roasted fish filled the air. Cole tended a large campfire, with Phoebe helping by fanning the flames. I was starving, but I had a job to do.<br><i>Get into proper stance,</i> I thought, going over the detailed instructions he told me. <i>Hold the bow steady. Aim well, and don't get your finger caught in the string for no reason.</i><br>I fired the arrow. It whistled in the wind and hit the tree with a <i>thunk.</i> My eyes were wide with shock.",
    "\"I did it,\" I managed.<br>Cole got up and looked around. He must've noticed the arrow, because he ran over and clapped me on the back, saying, \"Nice shot!\"<br>\"Does this mean I can shoot fish now?\" I asked stupidly.<br>\"You need more training.\" He paused, then added, \"But for now, I bet you're hungry. You can eat some of the fish.\"<br>When he said \"eat,\" I was already heading to the campfire. I sat across from Phoebe, since it was hot enough without a phoenix radiating heat. The fish tasted so good, and I didn't mind that it was steaming. <i>You're only spending the night,</i> I reminded myself. Even so, I sat there, coming up with tons of things I could do for the rest of the day.",
    "&#160&#160&#160&#160&#160&#160&#160&#160&#160&#160&#160&#160〜 🏹 〜<br><br>\"Harvest\" turned out to be worse than it sounded. I spent thirty minutes picking berries and I blamed it on Cole for having fifteen berry bushes.<br>\"Wait, <i>berries?</i>\" I had asked him earlier.<br>\"Yeah, wanna go pick them? Seems like today's harvest day.\"<br>I don't know what was wrong with me at the time, because I said \"sure\" not realizing how long that would take.<br>I was sweating waterfalls when I finished. Speeding towards the brook, I took a huge drink of trout water (normally, I wouldn't take big sips because I didn't trust the water, but this was an exception).",
    "I was thinking about how great it would be to take a swim in the cold water, but I wasn't sure if Cole would allow it. <i>Don't worry, you'll shower when you get back—</i> Get back. I hadn't been thinking about doing that in a while…<br><i>No, not yet, you agreed to stay the night, remember?</i> I walked back to the campfire, which was still ignited without anyone by it. Cole was doing something on top of the treehouse, and Phoebe napped inside it. Picking up a piece of firewood, I decided to take on something new: whittling. I quickly realized that I didn't have what it takes. Frustrated, I kept going, but after an hour of trying to carve with the worst possible blade (which was the head of one of Cole's arrows), I ended up with a wooden potato",
    "that appeared to have a sad face. I threw it poorly towards fire, and it helplessly missed. It made a loud cracking noise as it hit a rock.<br>Cole looked up from whatever he was doing. \"What was that?\"<br>\"Sorry. I was just being bad at whittling. How do you even do it?\" I glared at the arrow like it was its fault.<br>He stood up, and from far up I realized he was holding a book. \"I used a knife. Were you?\"<br>I was speechless. After a moment, I threw the arrow into the campfire (which resulted in a surprised \"Hey! What was that for?\" from above) and picked up my bow and quiver. <i>Maybe I should prove myself…</i> I thought. I glanced at the practice target tree, but my eyes fell towards",
    "the stream, fish swimming in every direction. <i>You know what? I'll try something else.</i><br>Hitting a fish was harder than I thought. I couldn't aim well since the trout wouldn't stop moving. Plus, the moment the arrow hit the water, it sunk slowly and in random directions. I knew I wouldn't get anywhere without going <i>into</i> the water itself, so after five attempts I took off my shoes and stepped in.<br>My first thought: <i>SO COLD—!</i> It was like a glacier had just melted into the creek. The second thing was that it was really slippery. Before getting ready to fire, I had to find a spot to stand on stable dirt instead of slick rocks. But even wading with the fish wasn't working, so I had to come up with another plan.",
    "Soon enough, I had one in mind. I slowly lowed my ready bow so the arrowhead was pointed straight at one fish. <i>Please, please, please…</i><br><i>Splish.</i> The arrow glided forward, and in a flurry of red and frightened fish, I attempted to retrieve it. I felt the smooth body of a fish practically sticking through the arrow like a kebab and pulled it out. It flopped for a few seconds before it died. <i>I did it.</i> I stood there stunned for a moment. <i>Wait WHAT?! I shot one!</i><br>\"Did you catch one?\" I heard Cole yell from far away. He must've been watching me the whole time.<br>\"Yeah!\" I grinned. I still couldn't believe I managed to do it. Quickly rinsing the blood off the fish, I took my catch back to the campfire.",
    "<br>&#160&#160&#160&#160&#160&#160&#160&#160&#160&#160&#160&#160〜 🏹 〜<br><br>As the sun began to set, we all ate in silence. Actually, I was the only one who was quiet. Phoebe ate her share of food in one bite and was apparently complaining (or squawking, whatever) about how little she got. Cole tried changing her mind, telling her that I was the one who had caught it. But she just looked away in refusal.<br>It was weird but interesting to watch. A question that had been tugging in my mind broke free.<br>\"How did you meet her?\" I asked, gesturing towards the phoenix.<br>He looked at me for a moment, a strange terror in his eyes. I wasn't sure if I was imagining",
    "it, but then he stared off towards the pink and orange sky. He was silent for a moment.<br>\"We were on a field trip,\" Cole said at last. He curled up like he was cold, but I didn't think that was the case. \"One of those camping trips. Me and…Rose.\"<br>That name again: <i>Rose.</i><br>\"Everything was going great, until—\" He paused. In the dim light of the fire, I swear I saw sweat trickling down his neck.<br>\"W-What happened?!\" I knew this was a really touchy subject, but the suspense was practically killing me.<br>\"I…ran off. Into the forest.\" He wouldn't make eye contact. \"And then…I heard gunshots. I don't—I don't really remember.\"<br>\"But wait, your friend Rose…\" I trailed off.",
    "He was wiping his eyes to hide the fact that he was crying.<br>\"I left her behind. She told me to go—\"<br>We were silent. He didn't mention what happened to Rose, but it dawned upon me soon enough. The gunshots…Rose sacrificed her life to protect the other students.<br>\"And that's when I found her,\" Cole said softly.<br>\"Was there only <i>one</i> phoenix?\" I asked. He hesitated, then nodded.<br>Phoebe shifted uneasily and nipped at him gently. She took off and flew into the treehouse.<br>\"Phoebe says it's lights out.\" He picked up a wooden bucket beside him filled with water and doused the campfire. Darkness settled over the area. I couldn't really see where I was going, but I managed to follow",
    "him into the treehouse. I totally forgot about my sleeping situation. I had no sleeping bag or anything—Cole had a hammock and Phoebe perched on a branch. But I was too tired to complain, so I found a spot on the floor and used my quiver as a pillow (though it felt like sleeping on sticks—literally). The ground was not comfy, and I couldn't fall asleep from the constant turning. Phoebe being a gigantic heat-radiating nightlight didn't help either. Right when I had found a decent position, something like a rolled-up carpet hit my face.<br>\"Oww!\" I sat up. The thing that smacked me looked like a jacket sleeve, except it was stuffed and closed at the ends.",
    "\"Sorry about that,\" Cole grimaced. I realized he had another one by him. \"Thought you might want it since you're sleeping on the floor and stuff.\"<br>\"Thanks, I guess…\" The sleeves were like low-quality plushies, but at least I had something. That night, I thought about my eventful day. A lot of weird things happened…<br>And then there was the talk about Rose and Phoebe. Who in the world would want to shoot students on a camping trip? Where and how did Cole even find Phoebe? My head was buzzing with questions. Plus, I completely forgot about Dad and Sarah; I had no idea what they were doing now. <i>Calm down,</i> I thought. <i>You can deal with all that when the time comes…\"",
    "I drifted off into sleep, wondering how the following day would unfold. I wish I knew sooner that it wouldn't go well.",

    "<bt>Intro</bt><br><br>Since the business of Tsokojin™, led by its CEO, Jeanne. The Tsokojin business expanded into the global chocolate industry. But as the Tsokojin™ increased in value, groups from smugglers and cartels interfered and made deals within the business. This increased the need for a private military to secure the company's assets. This private military group came to be, \"The Black Watch,\" to serve as Jeanne's elite bodyguard.",
    "<bt>Organisation</bt><br><br>All members of The Black Watch can join or leave at any time and therefore makes most of the Black Watch a purely volunteer militia. Also, any and all choices made by the militia are voted on by direct democracy. There are no official \"officers\" but most units could elect someone to lead and organise them. If you want to join, there are 5 ranks to climb up. From lowest to highest, they are: Wolves, Cats, Black Bears, Tigers, and Lotus.",
    "<bt>Organisation</bt><br><br><heading><b>Wolves</b></heading><br>Wolf ranked members are the main conscripts and volunteers of the Black Watch. Though numerous in manpower, they're easily expendable and must stay in formation so as to not break morale. Units within the Wolf rank include:<br>&#160• Otay Mustang Regiment<br>&#160• The Eagle Freikorps",
    "<bt>Organisation</bt><br><br><heading><b>Cats</b></heading><br>The Cat rank (nicknamed kittens) includes units that are more experienced than the Wolves and could stand firm in the midst of battle. Here, you can find the main frontline units. The Cat units include:<br>&#160• 1st Haksaeng Grenadiers<br>&#160• König Volunteer Foot Guard",
    "<bt>Organisation</bt><br><br><heading><b>Black Bears</b></heading><br>Meanwhile, Black Bear units don't usually face combat. Rather, they serve supporting as well as specialised roles that give the Black Watch more flexibility in different circumstances. Black Bear units include:<br>&#160• Osmanthus Sapper and Artillery Corps<br>&#160• Pororo Reserves",
    "<bt>Organisation</bt><br><br><heading><b>Tigers</b></heading><br>The Tigers serve as the elite units to the Black Watch. They receive superior training and equipment compared to the lower units. Also, Tigers serve as the powerful shock units such as cavalry and heavy infantry. Units of the Tigers include:<br>&#160• The König Dragoon Guard<br>&#160• Sai's Freikorps",
    "<bt>Organisation</bt><br><br><heading><b>Lotus</b></heading><br>The Lotus is the final rank and the highest rank in the Black Watch. The Lotus group are composed of generals, logistics managers, and certain members of the Black Watch that are elected on merit. When voting on decisions is no longer an option such as in battle, the Lotus could make their best decision in order to find a solution. They are the ones who organise and command the army in almost every situation.",
    "<bt>Equipment</bt><br><br>The Black Watch have a large variety of equipment and uniforms available to them. The most common colour in uniforms and insignias is black which gave them the name, “The Black Watch.” But Wolf or volunteer units don't have a strict dress code so they could wear normal civilian clothes with an armband or pin identifying them. Meanwhile, almost every unit could incorporate other colours into their regular uniforms but keep a mostly dark uniform. Also, depending on the weather, units could wear shorts and sandals in hot weather or wear coats and boots in colder weather. Now, here's a list of gear for all units.",
    "<bt>Equipment</bt><br><br><heading><b>Otay-Mustang Regiment</b></heading><br>&#160• Main colours: Grey and blue<br>&#160• Though they have no set uniform; Wearing clothing or armbands of their main colours serve as a way to distinguish themselves from other units.<br><br><br><heading><b>The Eagle Freikorps</b></heading><br>&#160• Main colours: Black and gold<br>&#160• Similar to the Otay Regiment in which they have no set uniform. But some troops sometimes wear formal attire such as ties, flat caps, and fedoras as in their uniform.",
    "<bt>Equipment</bt><br><br><heading><b>1st Haksaeng Grenadiers</b></heading><br>&#160• Main colours: Black and blue<br>&#160• Unlike other units, these Grenadiers have to carry rubber bands in case they could make a makeshift detonation device with 8 foam darts of any kind. They are also allowed to wear maid uniforms for reasons unknown.",
    "<bt>Equipment</bt><br><br><heading><b>König Volunteer Foot Guard</b></heading><br>&#160• Main colours: Black, light blue, and white<br>&#160• The Volunteer Foot Guard tend to be more formal in their attire. Therefore, black fedoras or clothing inspired by the military of The Confederation of the Rhine are common. Like the 1st Haksaeng Grenadiers, they can wear maid uniforms. Maybe it's because they're kittens?",
    "<bt>Equipment</bt><br><br><heading><b>Osmanthus Sapper and Artillery Corps</b></heading><br>&#160• Main colours: Orange, yellow, and black<br>&#160• Sappers and Artillerists often carry around heavy and bulk equipment (such as mobile cover). This means that most of them could wear almost any type of clothing as long as it matches with the main colours and is comfortable to work in.",
    "<bt>Equipment</bt><br><br><heading><b>Pororo Reserves</b></heading><br>&#160• Main colours: Dark blue, yellow, and white<br>&#160• The main colours and unit name were inspired by the popular cartoon character, Pororo the Little Penguin. Because of this, they tend to stand out from other units and are very noticeable in combat.",
    "<bt>Equipment</bt><br><br><heading><b>König Dragoon Guards</b></heading><br>&#160• Main colours: Black, blue, white<br>&#160• The Dragoons actually require some sort of mount or vehicle for their role of highly mobile infantry. But due to the lack of horses, most Dragoons tend to ride on bikes, and skateboards.",
    "<bt>Equipment</bt><br><br><heading><b>Sai's Freikorps</b></heading><br>&#160• Main colours: Black and green<br>&#160• The Sai's Freikorp are a multi-purpose unit which can serve as heavy infantry, skirmishers, and even cavalry. They tend to wear all black with long coats, boots, and ushanka hats but some prefer to wear green camo designs with blue jeans.",
    "<bt>Equipment</bt><br><br><heading><b>Lotus Uniforms</b></heading><br>Uniforms of the Lotus rank don't have much restrictions on uniforms. Rather, they could wear elaborate and unique uniforms to show off their rank. Some examples might be entire business suits, cosplay, and even maid outfits for comedic purposes.",

    "I woke up with a start. Mostly because something was burning my arm. Phoebe was snuggling up next to me, and I practically jumped.<br>\"Sorry,\" I whispered.<br>So I wasn't actually on fire. She blinked, then waddled out the door, beckoning me to follow. Her wings touched the door, and somehow they didn't ignite. Nodding, I proceeded outside.<br>I could tell it was early in the morning since a chilly wind had picked up. Through the trees, the sky was a dark shade of blue. Looking up, I realized Phoebe was on the side of the roof. Below her, there were wooden footholds in the wall like a ladder. I climbed up.<br>\"Whoa.\" The view was breathtaking. I could see over all the treetops, creating the",
    "image of a sea of multicolored leaves. In the midst of this, the sun began to peak out from below, illuminating the sky with pink and orange.<br>\"It's beautiful, isn't it?\" said a voice from behind.<br>I nearly fell off the roof. Cole climbed up to us and sat on the edge.<br>\"Wait, but don't you see the sunrise every day…?\" I asked.<br>\"I usually wake up later than this.\" He looked at me pointedly. \"But you were being too loud.\"<br>\"My bad…\"<br>We were silent for a bit. Not even the crickets were chirping yet.<br>\"Right, you're leaving today,\" Cole interrupted. \"Ah, if you're okay with it, can you tell me how you got here in the first place?\"",
    "\"Sure.\"<br>I told him the whole story; from the time since Mom died and Dad started dating Sarah to our camping trip.<br>\"…And, I don't know, I just kind of ended up here.\"<br>\"Kinda like…fate?\" Cole muttered.<br>I wasn't sure if I heard that right, and was about to ask before he spoke up again.<br>\"How did you do it?\" There was a serious tone in his voice.<br>\"Do what?\"<br>\"You shouldn't have been able to get here, to Charcoal Grove. Phoebe blocks incoming threats, and she would've detected you.\"<br>I thought for a moment. \"…I don't know.\"<br>\"Maybe she let you pass.\" He stroked the phoenix, who started squawking out of nowhere. \"Sometimes she makes no sense.",
    "She doesn't tell me everything, you know.\"<br>I shrugged. \"Anyways, I told you my story, so…\" I eyed him. \"What was Rose like?\"<br>His expression tensed a little. I quickly added, \"I-If you're fine telling me.\"<br>He was about to answer when a monstrous grumbling sound erupted out of nowhere. I realized the noise was coming from Phoebe. She was waddling in place and continued to squawk.<br>\"Whoa, is that her stomach?\"<br>Cole laughed. \"Guess it's the first time you heard that. She gets pretty feisty in cases like these.\"<br>Looking at the sky, it was already turning blue. Only after a few moments, the beautiful view was fading.<br>\"Alright, breakfast time!\" He turned to me.",
    "\"Oh, but you'll have to help out again.\"<br>\"Wha—?!\" I was dragged down the roof against my will. (exaggeration)<br><br>&#160&#160&#160&#160&#160&#160&#160&#160&#160&#160&#160&#160〜 🏹 〜<br><br>After breakfast by the campfire, I climbed up into the treehouse to grab my archery supplies. One more practice session would be fine before I left. I passed by the glowing arrows again. Looking more closely, the feathers on them appeared to be on fire. Were those <i>Phoebe's?</i><br>\"Hey Cole, what are these flaming arrows for?\" I called down below.<br>He walked up to the treehouse. \"Oh, <i>those?</i>\" He hesitated. \"They're for, umm…emergencies. And if you were wondering,",
    "Phoebe sheds feathers every now and then, so don't get the wrong idea.\"<br>I scooped up some (normal) arrows and searched for my bow. <i>Ugh, where did I leave it?</i> My eyes rested on Cole's backpack. There was a photograph on top, which was probably the thing I saw yesterday. <i>Just a peek would be fine…</i> I kneeled beside the bag and picked up the photo. The colors on it were a little faded and the corners were bent. About twenty kids were lined up in the image. One of them had wavy blond hair and wore a big smile. She looked just like me when I was in second grade. A sudden chill went down my spine. <i>Could that be…Rose?</i> My attention turned to the boy next to her. His black hair was a little messy. He had a gray sweatshirt that was clearly oversized, and",
    "he was wearing white shoes that looked fairly clean. I gasped. <i>This is definitely—</i><br>\"What are you doing?\" Cole stepped in through the doorframe. Busted.<br>I noticed he was holding something, but it disappeared. It was too obvious to hide anything, especially since I crouched next to his backpack. \"This photo…I get why you thought I was her.\"<br>He sighed. \"Well, I can't blame you for wanting to look through my bag,\" he laughed, \"If you can even call that a bag anymore. I ripped part of it for my quiver's strap as well as yours. Here, follow me.\"<br>Grabbing my bow, we climbed down the treehouse. He walked towards the creek and took a seat. <i>No practice, then?</i> Phoebe was busy trying to scorch a rabbit,",
    "shooting little fireballs at it. I eyed the shadowy figures in the water, darting this way and that. Sitting down beside him, I wondered if the water was actually clean.<br>\"Um, this is kind of random, but how often do you take baths?\" I realized that sounded rude. \"No offense.\"<br>\"Maybe like…every once in a while,\" he admitted. \"If I get lucky.\"<br>It made no sense, but we burst out laughing.<br>Cole sat upright. \"Oh yeah, I never answered your question earlier. Rose was funny, but also really brave. She was my only friend back then. She was stubborn at times, like how she really wanted to learn archery but couldn't master it at first. We were both into stories about myths. The one about phoenixes",
    "was our favorite. But as you can tell…\" Phoebe walked happily towards us with the rabbit in her mouth, still on fire.<br>\"…They're real,\" I finished. The phoenix earned herself a headpat for her catch.<br>He held the burnt rabbit. \"On…On the night when I left camp, I bet those hunters were after Phoebe.\"<br>\"What?!\" I shouted, making Phoebe jump.<br>\"Yeah, I've heard about them before. I don't…really like to talk about it, but I've seen you've been dying to know. They're known as 'terrorist-hunters.' This notorious guy called 'Wolf' is their leader. Apparently, they're willing to do some really terrible stuff to capture animals for the black market.\" He shuddered. \"Maybe…",
    "phoenixes were their next target.\"<br>Phoebe made the weirdest squawk and looked troubled. Cole petted her in reassurance. \"Hey, you're safe now. It's okay.\"<br>My eyes were still wide. \"And those guys still haven't been caught?!\"<br>\"Unfortunately, no. They're still on the loose. Apparently, they have a base somewhere that's carefully hidden.\" I didn't know how to perceive this.<br>\"Anyways, I got off topic. Rose mastered archery after a while, and she became even better than me. So why would she give up her life…?\" He started to sound choky again.<br>He kicked at the water, scaring the fish. Smiling weakly, he added, \"Stupid…she couldn't stand a chance…they kill tons of",
    "people, those hunters…\"<br>\"Hey…\" I patted his arm trying to help him feel better. Phoebe snuggled close to Cole, drying his tears immediately.<br>\"She was just a little chick when I found her,\" he muttered.<br>I looked up at him slyly. \"For some reason, I get the feeling…did you like Rose?\"<br>\"I-It depends what you mean by that,\" Cole turned away. I could see his ears reddening.<br>\"Anyways,\" I stood up. \"Should I catch lunch? Or more like, a souvenir to-go.\"<br>He rose. \"No, you don't have to.\"<br>\"Well, I've done it before. I think I've got the strategy down—Now I'll really look like Rose.\" I unslung my bow.<br>\"As if,\" I heard him mumble.<br>I gave him a puzzled look. Did he not realize he was being\",",
    "really harsh? \"Well, <i>fine.</i> I'll be leaving now. Thanks for everything,\" I said sarcastically.<br>Phoebe's flames flickered dangerously. I turned and strode away from them.<br>Now <i>I</i> was the one crying. \"I can't believe I thought we were friends.\" My voice cracked and tears spilled down my face.<br>Cole realized his mistake too late. \"Hold on, I didn't mean it like that—!\"<br>But by then, I was already on the run.<br>\"Eve, wait!!\" I could hear him running after me, but his footsteps faded. I clutched my bow to my chest. Leaves crunched under my feet as I ran along the stream. At some point, I stopped to catch my breath. Up ahead, a waterfall flowed endlessly, the source of the brook.",
    "<i>Great job, Eve,</i> I thought, <i>You just got déjà vu.</i> Wiping my eyes, I realized what I had done. I sighed. <i>Where am I this time?</i> I clearly didn't make it back to the Silver Woods camp. Looking around, the grass and trees weren't burnt at all. I heard the sound of a helicopter flying overhead. It was probably a search copter looking for me. Ignoring it, I walked over to the creek. In the still portion of the water, I saw my reflection. If only I hadn't looked like Rose… I stared at the water, thinking about how none of this would've happened if I didn't look like her.<br>Now I was completely lost. <i>I needed to go back to camp, but where do I go?</i> Admitting defeat, I walked back in the direction I came from.",
    "<i>You must hurry,</i> A voice said in my mind. Weirdly enough, it didn't even sound like <i>my</i> voice.<br><i>What for?</i> I responded. <i>I don't know how to face him.</i><br><i>There is grave danger ahead,</i> it pushed on. <i>You are the only one who can save us.</i><br>For a terrifying moment, I had the feeling Rose was speaking to me. <i>Wait, \"us?\"</i> I thought skeptically, <i>Who are you?</i><br><i>The phoenix, of course,</i> the voice said. Oh. I had no idea phoenixes can communicate telepathically. Even though her voice was regal, it had a stressful tone to it. <i>You need t—</i><br><i>What's wrong—?</i> I began. A wave of dread washed over me. The helicopter; Could that have been…? I remembered Cole saying, <i>\"Maybe…phoenixes were their next target.\"</i><br>",
    "All of a sudden, I heard a cry from far away. It was brave-sounding, but also somber.<br>Before I knew it, I bolted faster than ever, following the whir of the helicopter, which was fading. I knew exactly who that was, without a doubt.<br>\"PHOEBE!!\"",
    "<heading>Afternote</heading><br>…As you can tell I didn't manage to publish the book in 2023. I was pretty busy and lacked motivation. I actually finished the story back in March, but I wanted to release it alongside <i>Nunners' Guide To Dreams & Nightmares: Second Edition.</i> So I just released this book anyways without it after 3 more months. My motivation was also drained 'cause of my lost books, but I managed to recover the original drafts! I decided not to copy-paste since it needed some (by that I mean plenty of) revision. I hope you're not…that mad ^▿^;<br><br>Sorry about the procrastination. It's an increasing problem and even affects events on the NunnerVerse. So just bear with me, okay?",
    "I can't even promise a range for when the fourth book releases, let alone a specific month. Just know that the story gets good(?) and that there will be much more in the future.<br><br>Thanks to my sister (yet again) and friends for ideas and edits!",
