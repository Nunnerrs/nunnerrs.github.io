    // "<heading>Prologue</heading><br>Marcus walked out of the grocery store. He carried one bag, which held just one carton of milk. He felt awkward to go to the grocery store, only to buy some milk. He strolled across the street and onto the crosswalk.<br>It just happened. There wasn't any reason for the truck to go forward. The walk light was lit and the traffic light was red for a while. But the truck rushed without a care in the world, until the driver saw Marcus.<br>\"Look out!\" he yelled.<br>One glance, and Marcus knew. He didn't even have time to brace for impact.",
    // "The front slammed into him, and for a moment pain was the only thing he could think of. The milk he bought exploded onto the floor. Lightning coursed through his body at the blink of an eye. He became totally paralyzed and could not move. The last thing he could feel was his entire self collapsing, and then everything went black.<br>Moments later, he woke up from a bright light.<br><i>I think…I died?</i> Marcus thought. He looked around, but everything was too bright for his eyes. <i>So this is heaven…</i><br>He tried standing up, but could barely even move his head.",
    // "The pain started rushing back.<br><i>Oww, owwww…</i> He lied back down, feeling to frail to move. His eyes partially regained its focus. He could make out two silhouettes, people, looming over him.<br>\"Don't try too hard to stand just yet, \" Marcus heard one of the people say. It sounded like a man. The speaker turned to the other person next to him. \"Thank goodness she's alright.\"<br><i>I must be in a hospital…</i> Marcus thought. <i>Why'd I think I died, anyway?</i><br>The person next to the man gestured towards him. \"Well, we can't just watch her,\" she said (Marcus assumed that the other person is female from their voice)."
    // "\"Let's take her to be cleaned up.\"<br><i>Whoa, whoa, whoa…</i> Marcus thought. <i>They seriously didn't assume I'm a </i>girl<i> right now…I mean, I obviously look like a </i>man,<i> don't I?!</i><br>He blinked a couple times and was able to see better. The world around him wasn't as bright as before, but on the contrary was kind of dark. He could see that the two people were actually a man and a woman, but he wore overalls and she wore a straw hat. They were pretty tall for their age. Looking behind them, there were thin metal fences enclosing the small area he was in. The floor was littered with straw or hay.",

    "All around the room, girls in pink tutus were having last-minute ballet practice. Hope stood against the handrail, amazed at how skilled all the other girls were. From across the room, three girls pointed at Hope, who was wearing a white and brown tutu.<br>\"What is she even wearing?\" a black-haired girl smirked.<br>\"You're asking me?\" a girl beside her with green & blue hair sniggered. \"It looks like she got that from the dollar store!\"<br>\"Come on, that's mean,\" a blond-haired girl by them said. \"She at least spent two dollars on that thing she calls an outfit.\"<br>All three girls laughed to themselves.<br>The ballet instructor walked up to Hope. \"Hope, what's the",
    "matter?\"<br>\"Nothing,\" she replied. \"I'm just waiting for my dad to come.\"<br>\"He will, don't worry.\"<br>\"Maybe.\"<br>\"Just work on your pointe, you need to be prepared.\"<br>\"Yes, Miss.\" Hope nodded. She began to practice and tried not to worry. A man quickly made his way towards her. \"Hey sweetie, sorry I'm late,\" he said. \"Just got caught up in something.\"<br>\"It's okay,\" Hope reassured. \"At least you're here now.\"<br>\"Here, I picked out this flower, especially for you.\" Her dad held out a white flower and tucked it under her headband. \"Here you go.\"<br>She smiled, her face blushing red like her hair. \"Aww, thank you Dad. I love you.\"",
    "\"Well, I better go back to my seat,\" her dad said. He hugged Hope tightly. \"You'll do amazing, remember I believe in you.\"<br>&#160&#160&#160&#160&#160&#160&#160&#160&#160&#160&#160&#160✿ ✿ ✿<br>The music started playing, and all the ballerinas began dancing. Every seat in the audience was full. The ballerinas danced gracefully along with the music. Hope ran across the stage and leaped. She led the others in pointe at the center. Hope's dad sat in the front row, tears of joy in his eyes. Hope twirled in the center as the ballet performance came to a close. Her dad stood up and bursted into applause.<br>&#160&#160&#160&#160&#160&#160&#160&#160&#160&#160&#160&#160✿ ✿ ✿<br>In a diner open late at night, Hope's dad was busy at work.",
    "He mopped the floor, cooked the food, and cleaned the tables.<br>\"Hello?\" a woman sitting in a booth called. \"My burger has onions in it. I specifically asked for no onions.\"<br>\"I apologise,\" Hope's dad responded. \"I'll get you a new one right away.\"<br>He sighed as he finished preparing the burger.<br>Later in the night, he checked out groceries for a customer in a supermarket. He swept the floor and cleaned the isles too.<br>\"Richard, could I talk to you in my office?\" the manager said as he came up to him.<br>\"Yes, of course.\" he replied.<br>They entered the office, and the manager sat down.",
    "\"Well, you've been coming late to work recently,\" he began. \"And you've been slacking in your work performance. What's been going on?\"<br>\"I have a daughter. I need to take care of her.\" Richard explained. \"Plus, I have another job.\"<br>\"I think you're taking on more than you can handle,\" the manager said calmly. \"So, I am with no other choice but to relieve you from this job. You've been a brilliant employee.\"<br>\"I really need the money, please dont—\"<br>\"I have no other choice. I'm sorry.\"<br>\"Thank you for the opportunity.\" He walked out of the manager's office and to a park. There, he sat down and started crying.",
    "&#160&#160&#160&#160&#160&#160&#160&#160&#160&#160&#160&#160✿ ✿ ✿<br>The next day, Hope was performing ballet at the park. Her hat was placed upside-down on the floor for donations. A blond-haired boy placed a dollar bill in her hat.<br>\"You're really talented,\" he told her. \"You know that, right?\"<br>\"Oh, thanks…\" Hope blushed.<br>\"Uh, I'm Noah.\"<br>\"Hope.\"<br>\"Pretty name.\" Noah said.<br>\"Yeah, my dad says it's special.\"<br>\"Mhm.\"<br>\"Well, nice meeting you, Noah. I have to go now…\" Hope said.<br>\"Nice meeting you too.\"<br>Hope walked away, still smiling and blushing.<br>&#160&#160&#160&#160&#160&#160&#160&#160&#160&#160&#160&#160✿ ✿ ✿<br>\"Bye Lucy,\" Hope's dad called to his coworker at the diner. \"I'll see you tomorrow.\"",
    "\"See you, stay safe.\" Lucy replied. He went outside and began walking home. He looked around, feeling slighly uncomfortable. He continued, but was interrupted.<br>\"Stay where you are,\" a man behind him said. He wore a beanie and goggles, holding a gun pointed directly at Richard. Hope's dad turned around.<br>\"Look, I-I don't want any trouble,\" he told the gunman.<br>\"You aren't going to get any,\" the gunman threatened. \"As long as you give me what I want.\"<br>Tears welled up in his eyes as Hope's dad handed him a few dollar bills.<br>\"You're joking, right?\" the gunman said.",
    "\"It's all I have,\" Richard looked down at the floor. \"I work at a diner, I have a child…I don't have much…\"<br>\"Boohoo, cry me a river. There's an ATM <i>right there</i>,\" the gunman said, his gun still pointed at him. \"Take out some money or I'll put a bullet through your head.\"<br>\"I barely have any money in my account. I have <i>nothing</i>…\" he said. The gunman shoved him, but Richard punched him in the face and knocked him over. The gun fell out of his hands, and Richard quickly grabbed it. He pointed it at his attacker.<br>\"I know you won't do it,\" the gunman smirked. A gun went off loudly, but it wasn't the one Richard held. Hope's dad looked down at his chest, and fell to his knees.",
    "Another gunman stood behind him, watching Richard collapse. The two gunmen walked away, leaving him on the floor. Richard's life flashed before his eyes.<br><br>He remembered the day he met her at the park, her bright red hair, and the day he proposed to her, and when…<br>\"I'm sorry to say this but…\" the doctor told him all those years ago.<br>His memories of his wife came flooding back to him. Memories of her when she was pregnant…and her grave too. When she left this world.<br>\"…Your wife died during childbirth.\"",
    "He recalled the happy ones too, of the baby, of Hope growing up, learning how to ride a bike…All those bittersweet memories…<br><br>Lucy walked out of the diner, looking around after hearing the gunshot. Her eyes grew wide as she saw him and called for help.<br>&#160&#160&#160&#160&#160&#160&#160&#160&#160&#160&#160&#160✿ ✿ ✿<br>Back at home, Hope woke up with a strange feeling.<br>\"Dad?\" she called as she headed down stairs. \"Hmmm…I guess he's working a long shift.\"<br>Hope walked to school. During class, the intercom went off.<br>\"Hope Moore, please come to the principal's office.\"<br>Hope left and opened the door to the office. The principal sat at his desk, looking very concerned.",
    "\"Yes, sir? Why did you call me?\" Hope sat down, looking worried. \"I didn't do anything!\"<br>\"It's not about school…\" the principal said, not sure how to begin.<br>\"Then what is it?\"<br>\"Your dad…\"<br>\"Yeah, I was wondering about him, he wasn't at home—\"<br>\"Hope. Your dad is in the hospital…\"<br>\"What?! WHY?\" Hope cried, tears welling up in her eyes.<br>\"He was shot in the back. We're going to get you to the hospital now.\"<br>\"Is-is he okay?\"<br>\"We don't know yet…\" the principal told her. Hope sobbed in her hands while the principal watched her, not knowing how to comfort her.",

Her dad had a black eye and his arm was connected to a container of blood. A monitor beeped in the background, keeping track of his heart rate. He opened his eyes slightly.<br>\"Hope…\" her dad said. He was hit with an old memory of them.<br><br>Hope was doing homework while he washed the dishes.<br>\"Hey, Dad? Why did you name me Hope?\" she had asked.<br>\"Well,\" he responded. \"Your mom left us really early.\"<br>It had hurt him to recall the pain Hope's mom had gone through. He had fallen to his knees when he heard the doctor's unforgettable words.",
    "\"You never got to meet her, but she was the prettiest woman you'd ever see.\" Hope's dad had told her. \"I was heartbroken, but when I looked at you, I knew.\"<br>His eyes filled with tears as he washed the dishes. \"Your name is Hope, because hope is what you give me.\"<br>Hope blushed as she looked at her dad from across the room, her eyes brimming with tears.<br><br>\"Dad…?\" Hope glanced at her dad with a worried look. The monitor's beeps began to slow down. He smiled at Hope, and closed his eyes. Hope's heart dropped in her chest.<br>\"Dad…\" Tears spilled from her eyes as she gently shook his arm. \"Please…don't go…\"",
    "No response. The smile on her dad's face faded away.<br>\"No…\" Hope muttered. The sound from the monitor beeped without pausing.

    "<heading><b>Introduction</b></heading><br><b><i>Nunners' Guide To Dreams & Nightmares</i> is a stupid book that shouldn't be taken seriously</b>. If you're shocked or mad about what your dreams tell about you, just know it's probably not true. Don't think I'm diagnosing you or anything. Anyways, the <i>things-you-see-in-your-dreams</i> are sorted in alphabetical order. Meanings created by me except a few (see credits at the last page). And uh if you dreamt or had a nightmare last night don't forget to look for its meaning here.<br><br>Well, I hope you enjoy it!<br>— Nunners",
    "<heading><b>A</b></heading><br><b>Ants</b><br>If you dreamt you were being killed/trampled by a ton of ants, it shows that you're too weak/scared to even step on an ant lol. If you were dreaming about watching ants, you probably really like ants 'cause I don't know who dreams of ants…<br><br><b>Animal</b><br><i>See Ants/Bears/Bees/Cows/<br>Giraffes/Jellyfish/Koalas/<br>Lizards/Octopi</i>",
    "<heading><b>B</b></heading><br><b>Bears</b><br>If you dreamt that a bear attacked/killed you, you probably <i>won't</i> be attacked by a bear in the future. Ah, scratch that. Everyone's gonna be mauled to death by a bear in the near future (according to <i>Bears Want To Kill You</i> by Ethan Nicole). If you've been attacked by a bear in the past, your nightmare was probably just a cute little memory of the past, don't worry about it. Yeah…<br><br><b>Bees</b><br>If you dreamt that you were being swarmed by bees, it may be a result from a bad memory from the past relating to bees.",
    "<heading><b>B</b></heading><br><b>Bees (cont.)</b><br>Same goes for dreaming about being stung by one/many. If you had a nice dream about petting cute bees, then good for you since 12.5% of all people are terrified by them.<br><br><b>Burgers</b><br>If you dreamed about burgers then you're probably really obsessed with burgers. If you dream of burgers or any other junk food several more times this week, then you may develop obesity (joking). If you dreamt that someone stole your burger then oh no someone's gonna steal your burger today :C",
    "<heading><b>B</b></heading><br><b>Bulls</b><br>Bro what in the world you doin' dreaming about bulls????",
    "<heading><b>C</b></heading><br><b>Cheeseburgers</b><br><i>See Burgers</i><br><br><b>Cows</b><br>If you dreamt about cows, it could be because you ate some Chick-fil-a yesterday. If you didn't, then it probably means you really like cows for some reason. In many cultures, cows are considered sacred, so something really epic may happen to you soon. If you were dreaming that you got reincarnated as a cow, then maybe you read <i>I Got Reincarnated As A Cow</i> a bit too much. If you constantly dream of turning into a cow, then it's very likely that you <i>will</i> become one when you die. If you dreamt about male cows (called bulls get it right), then <i>see Bulls</i>.",
    "<heading><b>D</b></heading><br><b>Death</b><br>If you dreamt that you died, then you probably woke up right after (omg you did 😱). If you dreamt that someone you care about died, then uh oh <i>something similar might just happen</i> 👀",
    "<heading><b>E</b></heading><br><b>Egg</b><br>If you dreamt about cooked eggs, then you probably really want eggs for breakfast. Chances are, if you already ate breakfast, there weren't any eggs in it. Too bad.",
    "<heading><b>F</b></heading><br><b>Falling</b><br>If you dreamt that you were falling off a high height or into oblivion, there's probably some really big problems bugging you right now. But if you dreamt off falling off a high height on <i>purpose</i>, then…that's a different story…(<i>see Suicide</i>)",
    "<heading><b>G</b></heading><br><b>Giraffes</b><br>If you dreamt about giraffes, your neck will grow 5% longer than normal every month starting tomorrow 🦒.",
    "<heading><b>H</b></heading><br><b>Hamburgers</b><br><i>See Burgers</i>",
    "<heading><b>I</b></heading><br><b>Ice Cream</b><br>If you dreamt about ice cream, it shows that you look for all the sweetest things in life. I hope you didn't just eat ice cream for breakfast right now.",
    "<heading><b>J</b></heading><br><b>Jellyfish</b><br>If you dreamt about jellyfish, it shows you may look all cute on the outside, but you're actually really stingy on the inside.",
    "<heading><b>K</b></heading><br><b>Koalas</b><br>If you dreamt about koalas, you probably really want to go back to sleep right now. Maybe you're jealous they get to sleep so much and you're just here trying to stay awake.",
    "<heading><b>L</b></heading><br><b>Lizards</b><br>If you dreamt lizards, then there's probably lizards in your backyard right now. If you don't have a backyard, then you probably enjoy watching lizards skitter across sidewalks or something. Or they're being annoying pests where you frequently go to. If none of these apply to you, then you're probably just dying to see a lizard in-person.",
    "<heading><b>M</b></heading><br><b>Mad</b><br>If you dreamt about being mad at someone/some people you know (a friend, someone who lives with you), then you probably had an argument or fight recently (bro no way 😱). From the looks of it, the argument didn't end well because one person may have just stormed off or hurt someone (could be you). The best thing you and the people involved should do is ✨✨make up✨✨ and ✨✨apologise✨✨.",
    "<heading><b>N</b></heading><br><b>Net</b><br>If you dreamt about being caught in a net, it probably shows that you're tangled up in a problem that's been bothering you lately. If you were dreaming that you used a net to capture something, it shows that you like taking advantage of others, even if you may not realize it. Unless you trap animals for a living or something, and you were just doing so in your sleep. Otherwise, now's a good time to stop trapping animals for your Serenitea Pot.",
    "<heading><b>O</b></heading><br><b>Octopi</b><br>If you dreamt about octopi (or octopuses, whatever), maybe it's 'cause you saw/ate some recently. Like, you went to Sea World on the weekend or ate Takoyaki yesterday. But if you didn't, it shows that sometimes you just wanna camouflage with your surroundings or really want eight arms. I don't really think that's a problem, but if none of these apply to you then…you have a secret liking for octopi (that you may or may not realize) 🐙",
    "<heading><b>P</b></heading><br><b>Penguins</b><br>If you dreamt about penguins, then you have some crazy obsession over them (yeah anton). But if you're clearly aware that you do <i>not</i> have some crazy obsession over penguins, then this shows that you like the cold or waddle when you walk lol.",
    "<heading><b>Q</b></heading><br><b>Quails</b><br>If you dreamt about quails (coming soon)",
    "<heading><b>R</b></heading><br><b>Running</b><br>If you dreamt about running (coming soon)",
    "<heading><b>S</b></heading><br><b>Suicide</b><br>If you dreamt that you commit suicide, then you should attend some suicide counseling, I don't really know what to tell you—But if you were dreaming that someone you know/care about did, then uhhhh maybe tell them that you're there for them…? You may be forseeing the future or reading their thoughts somehow. 👀",
    "<heading><b>T</b></heading><br><b>Teeth</b><br>If you dreamt that a tooth fell out, then one of your teeth will most likely come out soon (if you still got baby teeth). If one/all of your teeth came out in your dream and you have all permanent teeth, then you're probably gonna lose something soon (it probably won't be just teeth).",
    "<heading><b>U</b></heading><br><b>Umbrellas</b><br>If you dreamt about umbrellas (coming soon)",
    "<heading><b>V</b></heading><br><b>Vases</b><br>If you dreamt about vases (coming soon)",

    "Year before, Hope stood with her dad at her mother's gravestone. Her grave was next to a beautiful water fountain. She placed a fresh bouquet of white roses in front of it. After some time of mourning, they walked down the path towards the exit of the graveyard.<br>Hope held her dad's hand. \"What color was her hair?\"<br>\"Red, just like yours,\" he responded.<br>\"I wish I could have met her…\"<br>\"I wish you could have too,\" her dad sighed. \"She was just like you, you know. She wanted to be a ballerina too, professionally.\"<br>\"But why didn't she?\"",
    "\"Well, she gave that all up for you,\" he smiled. \"She had plans to go back to college and so did I.\"<br>\"Daddy,\" Hope looked down at the ground.<br>\"What's wrong?\"<br>\"Did I kill her, Daddy?\" Hope looked at her dad, eyes full of tears.<br>\"Oh my gosh, of course not.\" He hugged her as she sobbed into his arms.<br><br>&#160&#160&#160&#160&#160&#160&#160&#160&#160&#160&#160&#160✿ ✿ ✿<br><br>The memories in Hope's heart were still so vivid. The endless ring of the monitor next to her dad's hospital bed. The white flower she placed on top of his coffin. Her dad giving her the white flower before her recital.",
    "The time she walked with him when she was little, and the time she rode a bike for the first time. The last hug he ever gave her before saying goodbye. Her dad applauding for her after the performance. And the ride to the orphanage.<br><br>In a bathroom stall, Hope was panicking, breathing heavily. Noah walked in.<br>\"Hope? Everyone's looking for you,\" Noah said.<br>\"I-I can't do this…\" Hope told him, tears already forming in her eyes.<br>\"Of course you can. You've been practicing for weeks.\" He tried cheering her up.<br>\"No, I can't.\" She looked down at the floor of the stall. \"Not without my dad…\"",
    "Noah sighed and leaned his arm against Hope's stall. \"I know how you feel, trust me.\"<br>Hope's breathing suddenly becomes heavy and uneven. She looked up at Noah who stood in front of the door. \"I-I think I'm having a panic attack—\"<br>\"Oh—uhhh…t-try breathing slowly,\" Noah suggested.<br>\"I'm trying, it's not working—\"<br>\"Then, try counting to ten with me. I'll help you.\" he reassured. \"Okay, one…\"<br>\"Two…\"<br>\"Three…\"<br><br>Hope performs a pirouette, comepletely calm. Noah sat at the front of the audience and blushed at how talented she was.

Outside, Hope sat with Noah on one of the tall structures.<br>\"You were really good earlier!\" Noah smiled.<br>\"Thanks,\" she replied.<br>Noah looked at the ground below with a frown. Hope was quick to notice his feelings.<br>\"Hey, what's wrong?\"<br>\"Oh, nothing. I was just…thinking.\"<br>\"You don't need to lie.\" Hope smiled at him. \"I'm here for you.\"<br>Hope took his hand and Noah looked up at her. \"…Always\" she added.",
    "\"…I-I—\" he stammered. \"I was thinking about my dad.\"<br>Hope remembered they were in an orphanage. \"What was he like?\"<br>\"Well…that's the thing,\" Noah said. \"I…don't know. I never met him.\"<br>Noah winced at the thought. \"They said he dumped me here in a wooden basket. Moses style, with a note.\"<br>\"Wait…what happened to the note?\"<br>\"I have it here. They gave it to me a few months ago when I turned 15.\"<br>\"I don't know if it's too personal to ask, but could I see it?\" Hope asked.<br>\"Yeah…sure.\" Noah searched through his pockets and pulled out a small piece of paper. It read, \"<i>Do not try to find me…Noah is better off without me.</i>\"",
    "\"Noah…\" Hope began. \"I only came here a few months ago. Is this why you were so upset?\"<br>\"I…\" Tears welled up in his eyes. \"I just get sad sometimes, you know? When I have football practice, I look at the crowd to see if someone is holding a sign for me, someone cheering me on, someone that loves me…\"<br>He paused. \"I see no one.<br>\"Parent-teacher conferences come along, and I come with my freaking social worker while everyone's with their mom and dad.\"<br>A tear rolled down his cheek. \"I'm sorry…I just…\"<br>\"No, let it out,\" Hope told him. Noah closed his eyes.<br>\"Sometimes it just hits me. I…I have no one. Nobody…\"",
    "Hope gave him a reassuring hug and he began to cry. \"You have me,\" she said. Noah didn't say anything and sobbed in her arms.<br><br>&#160&#160&#160&#160&#160&#160&#160&#160&#160&#160&#160&#160✿ ✿ ✿<br><br>The next day, Hope held her textbooks in her arms through the school entrance. Suddenly, a familiar black-haired girl and her friends walked up to her.<br>\"Hah, look which freak decided to come to our school.\"<br>She quickly poured water on the floor in front of her. Hope didn't even have time to realize what was going on before she slipped.<br>\"Oops…sorry,\" the girl said, looking down at her. The three of them laughed.<br>\"I-It's okay…\" Hope said.",
    "She walked away ashamed as the girls continued to laugh at her.<br>\"Annie?\" the blond-haired one called towards Hope. Hope turned towards her with her head still down. The girls became amused.<br>\"Annie, is that you?\" she called again.<br>\"No, my name is Hope…\" she said.<br>\"No, I mean Annie, from the movie? The orphan?\" the girl smirked. \"You know her right?\"<br>\"I-I…\" Hope tried holding back the tears forming in her eyes, but she couldn't. She ran off crying, the three bullies laughing wildly.<br><br>Later at lunchtime, Hope looked around to find a seat. A shaggy-haired boy sitting in one of the tables looked over at her.<br>\"Is that her?\" he sneered.",
    "The mean girls from earlier sat nearby.<br>\"Yep,\" said the leader.<br>\"I'll be right back,\" he stood up. The bullies watched with a cold grin.<br>Hope looked at them in confusion. The boy walked up to Hope and slammed her food out of her hands.<br>\"Oops, my bad, haha,\" he looked down at the ruined food on the floor.<br>Hope bent down to pick it back up when he stepped all over it before she had the chance. She looked up sadly at the boy, tears already emerging. Hope only had a few seconds to see Noah running towards them and punching the boy.<br>\"Do you think you're funny?\" he glared at him.",
    "Blood oozed out from his nose because of the impact. The shaggy-haired kid just laughed at him. In the blink of an eye, he shoved Noah to the ground and started kicking his face. All the other students in the cafeteria gaped at the two boys fighting.<br>The principal stormed in. \"Both of you to the nurse's office now!\" he yelled. \"And make sure you pay my office a visit once you're done!\"<br><br>&#160&#160&#160&#160&#160&#160&#160&#160&#160&#160&#160&#160✿ ✿ ✿<br><br>Hope held an ice pack against Noah's head. He was still in bad shape after the fight, with a black eye and bruises.<br>\"You didn't have to do that, you know.\" Hope sighed at the condition of his face.",
    "\"I did,\" Noah said. \"I couldn't stand you being treated like that.\"<br>A tear fell down Hope's eye.<br>\"Why are you crying?\" he asked worriedly.<br>\"I've just never had someone care for me like you do, since…\" Hope's face turned red. \"Well, you know…\"<br>Noah smiled. \"Well, I—\"<br>Hope leaned forward and kissed.<br><br>&#160&#160&#160&#160&#160&#160&#160&#160&#160&#160&#160&#160✿ ✿ ✿<br><br>The next day, Hope sat at a policeman's desk. Her social worker sat at one end of the room.<br>\"Hope, we have disappointing news about the investigation of you father,\" the policeman said with a concerned look.",
    "\"W-What is it?\" Hope said anxiously.<br>\"Well…\"<br>\"TELL ME. Don't sugarcoat it.\"<br>\"The surveillance cameras on that street were broken, as the street was so run-down. Therefore, we cannot find enough evidence to rule your father's death as a murder.\"<br>\"What?\" she looked at him like he was crazy.<br>He continued. \"The wounds appear to be self-inflicted—\"<br>\"What abount the blood?\" Hope said in a panic. \"The witness? <i>Anything?!</i>\"<br>\"According to the breathalyzer, the witness had been drinking that night, so they're an invalid witness.\"<br>The policeman took a deep breath.",
    "\"I'm sorry to say this, but we've come to the conclusion…that your father killed himself.\"<br>\"No…no…\" Hope couldn't bear what she was hearing.<br>\"I'm very sorry, you have my condolences. It may be hard to accept—\"<br>\"It can't be…\" she looked up at the policeman.<br>\"We have a helpline ready for you to call if you're feeling—\"<br>Hope put her fists down on his desk. \"NO! My father didn't kill himself.\"<br>She stared at him defiantly. \"He worked and he worked to support us, to support <i>me</i>. He would come home late after a shift and still use whatever little energy he had left to cook me dinner.\"<br>A tear ran down her face.",
    "\"He gave <i>everything</i> for me. He would <i>NEVER</i> kill himself.\" She took off, leaving the policeman feeling guilty.<br>\"Hope, wait!\" her social worker stood up hurriedly.<br><br>Hope sat curled up by a bush in the park. Her eyes were still wet from crying. She reminisced a time her dad had placed a bandage on her knee when she scraped it during ballet.<br>\"Never give up in what you believe in,\" he told her then. \"Remember that, okay?\"<br>\"I will,\" she responded. Hope remembered that she had cried when she had gotten injured, and that it was her dad who cheered her up.<br>She had a determined look on her face. \"I will get my dad justice.\"",
    "Hope walked down the street near the diner her dad used to work at. It was late at night, so it looked abandoned. She turned and pictured her dad on the ground there, tears in his eyes after he had been imaginarily shot, though it did really happen before. Before she knew it, someone appeared in front of her.<br>\"Oh, sweetie,\" said a man dressed in all black. He wore a beanie and goggles and his voice sounded cold and sarcastic.<br>\"You shouldn't be on these streets this late at night.\"<br>Hope didn't say anything and did not take her eyes off the object he held. It was a gun.",
    "\"You did it…didn't you?\" Hope murmured, trying to keep the fear out of her voice.<br>\"Did what?\" the gunman asked, pretending to have no clue.<br>\"You killed my father…\" Hope began to get agitated at him.<br>\"I don't know what you're talking about, sweetie.\" he replied in an annoying voice.<br>Hope couldn't contain it anymore. \"STOP CALLING ME THAT!\" she yelled.<br>The man took off his goggles and showed his serious face. He pointed his gun at her.<br>\"You might want to reduce your volume",
