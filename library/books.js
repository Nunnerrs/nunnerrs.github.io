    "All around the room, girls in pink tutus were having last-minute ballet practice. Hope stood against the handrail, amazed at how skilled all the other girls were. From across the room, three girls pointed at Hope, who was wearing a white and brown tutu.<br>\"What is she even wearing?\" a black-haired girl smirked.<br>\"You're asking me?\" a girl beside her with green & blue hair sniggered. \"It looks like she got that from the dollar store!\"<br>\"Come on, that's mean,\" a blonde-haired girl by them said. \"She at least spent two dollars on that thing she calls an outfit.\"<br>All three girls laughed to themselves.<br>The ballet instructor walked up to Hope. \"Hope, what's the",
    "matter?\"<br>\"Nothing,\" she replied. \"I'm just waiting for my dad to come.\"<br>\"He will, don't worry.\"<br>\"Maybe.\"<br>\"Just work on your pointe, you need to be prepared.\"<br>\"Yes, Miss.\" Hope nodded. She began to practice and tried not to worry. A man quickly made his way towards her. \"Hey sweetie, sorry I'm late,\" he said. \"Just got caught up in something.\"<br>\"It's okay,\" Hope reassured. \"At least you're here now.\"<br>\"Here, I picked out this flower, especially for you.\" Her dad held out a white flower and tucked it under her headband. \"Here you go.\"<br>She smiled, her face blushing red like her hair. \"Aww, thank you Dad. I love you.\"",
    "\"Well, I better go back to my seat,\" her dad said. He hugged Hope tightly. \"You'll do amazing, remember I believe in you.\"<br>&#160&#160&#160&#160&#160&#160&#160&#160&#160&#160&#160&#160✿ ✿ ✿<br>The music started playing, and all the ballerinas began dancing. Every seat in the audience was full. The ballerinas danced gracefully along with the music. Hope ran across the stage and leaped. She led the others in pointe at the center. Hope's dad sat in the front row, tears of joy in his eyes. Hope twirled in the center as the ballet performance came to a close. Her dad stood up and bursted into applause.<br>&#160&#160&#160&#160&#160&#160&#160&#160&#160&#160&#160&#160✿ ✿ ✿<br>In a diner open late at night, Hope's dad was busy at work.",
    "He mopped the floor, cooked the food, and cleaned the tables.<br>\"Hello?\" a woman sitting in a booth called. \"My burger has onions in it. I specifically asked for no onions.\"<br>\"I apologise,\" Hope's dad responded. \"I'll get you a new one right away.\"<br>He sighed as he finished preparing the burger. Later in the night, he checked out groceries for a customer in a store. He swept the floor and cleaned the isles too.<br>\"Richard, could I talk to you in my office?\" the manager said as he came up to him.<br>\"Yes, of course.\" he replied.<br>They entered the office, and the manager sat down.",
    "\"Well, you've been coming late to work recently,\" he began. \"And you've been slacking in your work performance. What's been going on?\"<br>\"I have a daughter. I need to take care of her.\" Richard explained. \"Plus, I have another job.\"<br>\"I think you're taking on more than you can handle,\" the manager said calmly. \"So, I am with no other choice but to relieve you from this job. You've been a brilliant employee.\"<br>\"I really need the money, please dont—\"<br>\"I have no other choice. I'm sorry.\"<br>\"Thank you for the opportunity.\" He walked out of the manager's office and to a park. There, he sat down and started crying.",
    "&#160&#160&#160&#160&#160&#160&#160&#160&#160&#160&#160&#160✿ ✿ ✿<br>The next day, Hope was performing ballet at the park. Her hat was placed upside-down on the floor for donations. A blond-haired boy placed a dollar bill in her hat.<br>\"You're really talented,\" he told her. \"You know that, right?\"<br>\"Oh, thanks…\" Hope blushed.<br>\"Uh, I'm Noah.\"<br>\"Hope.\"<br>\"Pretty name.\" Noah said.<br>\"Yeah, my dad says it's special.\"<br>\"Mhm.\"<br>\"Well, nice meeting you, Noah. I have to go now…\" Hope said.<br>\"Nice meeting you too.\"<br>Hope walked away, still smiling and blushing.<br>&#160&#160&#160&#160&#160&#160&#160&#160&#160&#160&#160&#160✿ ✿ ✿<br>\"Bye Lucy,\" Hope's dad called to his coworker at the diner. \"I'll see you tomorrow.\"",
    "\"See you, stay safe.\" Lucy replied. He went outside and began walking home. He looked around, feeling slighly uncomfortable. He continued, but was interrupted.<br>\"Stay where you are,\" a man behind him said. He wore a beanie and goggles, holding a gun pointed directly at Richard. Hope's dad turned around.<br>\"Look, I-I don't want any trouble,\" he told the gunman.<br>\"You aren't going to get any,\" the gunman threatened. \"As long as you give me what I want.\"<br>Tears welled up in his eyes as Hope's dad handed him a few dollar bills.<br>\"You're joking, right?\" the gunman said.",
    "\"It's all I have,\" Richard looked down at the floor. \"I work at a diner, I have a child…I don't have much…\"<br>\"Boohoo, cry me a river. There's an ATM <i>right there</i>,\" the gunman said, his gun still pointed at him. \"Take out some money or I'll put a bullet through your head.\"<br>\"I barely have any money in my account. I have <i>nothing</i>…\" he said. The gunman shoved him, but Richard punched him in the face and knocked him over. The gun fell out of his hands, and Richard quickly grabbed it. He pointed it at his attacker.<br>\"I know you won't do it,\" the gunman smirked. A gun went off loudly, but it wasn't the one Richard held. Hope's dad looked down at his chest, and fell to his knees.",
    "Another gunman stood behind him, watching Richard collapse. The two gunmen walked away, leaving him on the floor. Richard's life flashed before his eyes.<br><br>He remembered the day he met her at the park, her bright red hair, and the day he proposed to her, and when…<br>\"I'm sorry to say this but…\" the doctor told him all those years ago.<br>His memories of his wife came flooding back to him. Memories of her when she was pregnant…and her grave too. When she left this world.<br>\"…Your wife died during childbirth.\"",
    "He recalled the happy ones too, of the baby, of Hope growing up, learning how to ride a bike…All those bittersweet memories…<br><br>Lucy walked out of the diner, looking around after hearing the gunshot. Her eyes grew wide as she saw him and called for help.<br>&#160&#160&#160&#160&#160&#160&#160&#160&#160&#160&#160&#160✿ ✿ ✿<br>Back at home, Hope woke up with a strange feeling.<br>\"Dad?\" she called as she headed down stairs. \"Hmmm…I guess he's working a long shift.\"<br>Hope walked to school. During class, the intercom went off.<br>\"Hope Moore, please come to the principal's office.\"<br>Hope left and opened the door to the office. The principal sat at his desk, looking very concerned.",
    "\"Yes, sir? Why did you call me?\" Hope sat down, looking worried. \"I didn't do anything!\"<br>\"It's not about school…\" the principal said, not sure how to begin.<br>\"Then what is it?\"<br>\"Your dad…\"<br>\"Yeah, I was wondering about him, he wasn't at home—\"<br>\"Hope. Your dad is in the hospital…\"<br>\"What?! WHY?\" Hope cried, tears welling up in her eyes.<br>\"He was shot in the back. We're going to get you to the hospital now.\"<br>\"Is-is he okay?\"<br>\"We don't know yet…\" the principal told her. Hope sobbed in her hands while the principal watched her, not knowing how to comfort her.",
    "&#160&#160&#160&#160&#160&#160&#160&#160&#160&#160&#160&#160✿ ✿ ✿<br>Hope held her dad's hand as tears streaked down her cheeks. Her dad had a black eye and his arm was connected to a container of blood. A monitor beeped in the background, keeping track of his heart rate. He opened his eyes slightly.<br>\"Hope…\" her dad said. He was hit with an old memory of them.<br><br>Hope was doing homework while he washed the dishes.<br>\"Hey, Dad? Why did you name me Hope?\" she had asked.<br>\"Well,\" he responded. \"Your mom left us really early.\"<br>It had hurt him to recall the pain Hope's mom had gone through. He had fallen to his knees when he heard the doctor's unforgettable words.",
    "\"You never got to meet her, but she was the prettiest woman you'd ever see.\" Hope's dad had told her. \"I was heartbroken, but when I looked at you, I knew.\"<br>His eyes filled with tears as he washed the dishes. \"Your name is Hope, because hope is what you give me.\"<br>Hope blushed as she looked at her dad from across the room, her eyes brimming with tears.<br><br>\"Dad…?\" Hope glanced at her dad with a worried look. The monitor's beeps began to slow down. He smiled at Hope, and closed his eyes. Hope's heart dropped in her chest.<br>\"Dad…\" Tears spilled from her eyes as she gently shook his arm. \"Please…don't go…\"",
    "No response. The smile on her dad's face faded away.<br>\"No…\" Hope muttered. The sound from the monitor beeped without pausing. She collapsed in her chair, streams of tears falling non-stop.<br>&#160&#160&#160&#160&#160&#160&#160&#160&#160&#160&#160&#160✿ ✿ ✿<br>The pain in her chest never left. Hope stared at her dad's casket with the priest. She placed a white flower on top of it.<br>\"I picked out this flower, especially for you, Dad.\" Hope said, trying to choke back her tears.<br><br>Hope rolled her luggage behind her as she followed the woman giving her a ride. She cried as she watched her childhood home fade off in the distance.",
    "The woman opened the car door and led Hope to Sarah's Orphanage. When they walked inside, Hope spotted a blond-haired boy sitting in a corner. His face was buried in his knees, and when he looked up Hope saw tears running down his face.<br>Her eyes grew wide and tons of questions raced across her mind. \"Noah…?\"<br><br><i>Hope Vol. 2</i> coming in March 2023!",

    "<heading><b>Introduction</b></heading><br><b><i>Nunners' Guide To Dreams & Nightmares</i> is a stupid book that shouldn't be taken seriously</b>. If you're shocked or mad about what your dreams tell about you, just know it's probably not true. Don't think I'm diagnosing you or anything. Anyways, the <i>things-you-see-in-your-dreams</i> are sorted in alphabetical order. Meanings created by me except a few (see credits at the last page). And uh if you dreamt or had a nightmare last night don't forget to look for its meaning here.<br><br>Well, I hope you enjoy it!<br>— Nunners",
    "<heading><b>A</b></heading><br><b>Ants</b><br>If you dreamt you were being killed/trampled by a ton of ants, it shows that you're too weak/scared to even step on an ant lol. If you were dreaming about watching ants, you probably really like ants 'cause I don't know who dreams of ants…<br><br><b>Animal</b><br><i>See Ants/Bears/Bees/Cows/<br>Giraffes/Jellyfish/Koalas/Lizards</i>",
    "<heading><b>B</b></heading><br><b>Bears</b><br>If you dreamt that a bear attacked/killed you, you probably <i>won't</i> be attacked by a bear in the future. Ah, scratch that. Everyone's gonna be mauled to death by a bear in the near future (according to <i>Bears Want To Kill You</i> by Ethan Nicole). If you've been attacked by a bear in the past, your nightmare was probably just a cute little memory of the past, don't worry about it. Yeah…<br><br><b>Bees</b><br>If you dreamt that you were being swarmed by bees, it may be a result from a bad memory from the past relating to bees.",
    "<heading><b>B</b></heading><br><b>Bees (cont.)</b><br>Same goes for dreaming about being stung by one/many. If you had a nice dream about petting cute bees, then good for you since 12.5% of all people are terrified by them.<br><br><b>Burgers</b><br>If you dreamed about burgers then you're probably really obsessed with burgers. If you dream of burgers or any other junk food several more times this week, then you may develop obesity (joking). If you dreamt that someone stole your burger then oh no someone's gonna steal your burger today :C",
    "<heading><b>B</b></heading><br><b>Bulls</b><br>Bro what in the world you doin' dreaming about bulls????",
    "<heading><b>C</b></heading><br><b>Cheeseburgers</b><br><i>See Burgers</i><br><br><b>Cows</b><br>If you dreamt about cows, it could be because you ate some Chick-fil-a yesterday. If you didn't, then it probably means you really like cows for some reason. In many cultures, cows are considered sacred, so something really epic may happen to you soon. If you were dreaming that you got reincarnated as a cow, then maybe you read <i>I Got Reincarnated As A Cow</i> a bit too much. If you constantly dream of turning into a cow, then it's very likely that you <i>will</i> become one when you die. If you dreamt about male cows (called bulls get it right), then <i>see Bulls</i>.",
    "<heading><b>D</b></heading><br><b>Death</b><br>If you dreamt that you died, then you probably woke up right after (omg you did 😱). If you dreamt that someone you care about died, then uh oh <i>something similar might just happen</i> 👀",
    "<heading><b>E</b></heading><br><b>Egg</b><br>If you dreamt about cooked eggs, then you probably really want eggs for breakfast. Chances are, if you already ate breakfast, there weren't any eggs in it. Too bad.",
    "<heading><b>F</b></heading><br><b>Falling</b><br>If you dreamt that you were falling off a high height or into oblivion, there's probably some really big problems bugging you right now. But if you dreamt off falling off a high height on <i>purpose</i>, then…that's a different story…(<i>see Suicide</i>)",
    "<heading><b>G</b></heading><br><b>Giraffes</b><br>If you dreamt about giraffes, your neck will grow 5% longer than normal every month starting tomorrow 🦒.",
    "<heading><b>H</b></heading><br><b>Hamburgers</b><br><i>See Burgers</i>",
    "<heading><b>I</b></heading><br><b>Ice Cream</b><br>If you dreamt about ice cream, it shows that you look for all the sweetest things in life. I hope you didn't just eat ice cream for breakfast right now.",
    "<heading><b>J</b></heading><br><b>Jellyfish</b><br>If you dreamt about jellyfish, it shows you may look all cute on the outside, but you're actually really stingy on the inside.",
    "<heading><b>K</b></heading><br><b>Koalas</b><br>If you dreamt about koalas, you probably really want to go back to sleep right now. Maybe you're jealous they get to sleep so much and you're just here trying to stay awake.",
    "<heading><b>L</b></heading><br><b>Lizards</b><br>If you dreamt lizards, then there's probably lizards in your backyard right now. If you don't have a backyard, then you probably enjoy watching lizards skitter across sidewalks or something. Or they're being annoying pests where you frequently go to. If none of these apply to you, then you're probably just dying to see a lizard in-person.",
    "<heading><b>M</b></heading><br><b>Mad</b><br>If you dreamt about being mad at someone/some people you know (a friend, someone who lives with you), then you probably had an argument or fight recently (bro no way 😱). From the looks of it, the argument didn't end well because one person may have just stormed off or hurt someone (could be you). The best thing you and the people involved should do is ✨✨make up✨✨ and ✨✨apologise✨✨.",
    "<heading><b>S</b></heading><br><b>Suicide</b><br>If you dreamt that you commit suicide, then you should attend some suicide counseling, I don't really know what to tell you—But if you were dreaming that someone you know/care about did, then uhhhh maybe tell them that you're there for them…? You may be forseeing the future or reading their thoughts somehow. 👀",
    "<heading><b>T</b></heading><br><b>Teeth</b><br>If you dreamt that a tooth fell out, then one of your teeth will most likely come out soon (if you still got baby teeth). If one/all of your teeth came out in your dream and you have all permanent teeth, then you're probably gonna lose something soon (it probably won't be just teeth).",
