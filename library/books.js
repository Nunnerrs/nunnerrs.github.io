    // "<heading>Prologue</heading><br>Marcus walked out of the grocery store. He carried one bag, which held just one carton of milk. He felt awkward to go to the grocery store, only to buy some milk. He strolled across the street and onto the crosswalk.<br>It just happened. There wasn't any reason for the truck to go forward. The walk light was lit and the traffic light was red for a while. But the truck rushed without a care in the world, until the driver saw Marcus.<br>\"Look out!\" he yelled.<br>One glance, and Marcus knew. He didn't even have time to brace for impact.",
    // "The front slammed into him, and for a moment pain was the only thing he could think of. The milk he bought exploded onto the floor. Lightning coursed through his body at the blink of an eye. He became totally paralyzed and could not move. The last thing he could feel was his entire self collapsing, and then everything went black.<br>Moments later, he woke up from a bright light.<br><i>I think…I died?</i> Marcus thought. He looked around, but everything was too bright for his eyes. <i>So this is heaven…</i><br>He tried standing up, but could barely even move his head.",
    // "The pain started rushing back.<br><i>Oww, owwww…</i> He lied back down, feeling to frail to move. His eyes partially regained its focus. He could make out two silhouettes, people, looming over him.<br>\"Don't try too hard to stand just yet, \" Marcus heard one of the people say. It sounded like a man. The speaker turned to the other person next to him. \"Thank goodness she's alright.\"<br><i>I must be in a hospital…</i> Marcus thought. <i>Why'd I think I died, anyway?</i><br>The person next to the man gestured towards him. \"Well, we can't just watch her,\" she said (Marcus assumed that the other person is female from their voice)."
    // "\"Let's take her to be cleaned up.\"<br><i>Whoa, whoa, whoa…</i> Marcus thought. <i>They seriously didn't assume I'm a </i>girl<i> right now…I mean, I obviously look like a </i>man,<i> don't I?!</i><br>He blinked a couple times and was able to see better. The world around him wasn't as bright as before, but on the contrary was kind of dark. He could see that the two people were actually a man and a woman, but he wore overalls and she wore a straw hat. They were pretty tall for their age. Looking behind them, there were thin metal fences enclosing the small area he was in. The floor was littered with straw or hay.",

    "All around the room, girls in pink tutus were having last-minute ballet practice. Hope stood against the handrail, amazed at how skilled all the other girls were. From across the room, three girls pointed at Hope, who was wearing a white and brown tutu.<br>\"What is she even wearing?\" a black-haired girl smirked.<br>\"You're asking me?\" a girl beside her with green & blue hair sniggered. \"It looks like she got that from the dollar store!\"<br>\"Come on, that's mean,\" a blond-haired girl by them said. \"She at least spent two dollars on that thing she calls an outfit.\"<br>All three girls laughed to themselves.<br>The ballet instructor walked up to Hope. \"Hope, what's the",
    "matter?\"<br>\"Nothing,\" she replied. \"I'm just waiting for my dad to come.\"<br>\"He will, don't worry.\"<br>\"Maybe.\"<br>\"Just work on your pointe, you need to be prepared.\"<br>\"Yes, Miss.\" Hope nodded. She began to practice and tried not to worry. A man quickly made his way towards her. \"Hey sweetie, sorry I'm late,\" he said. \"Just got caught up in something.\"<br>\"It's okay,\" Hope reassured. \"At least you're here now.\"<br>\"Here, I picked out this flower, especially for you.\" Her dad held out a white flower and tucked it under her headband. \"Here you go.\"<br>She smiled, her face blushing red like her hair. \"Aww, thank you Dad. I love you.\"",
    "\"Well, I better go back to my seat,\" her dad said. He hugged Hope tightly. \"You'll do amazing, remember I believe in you.\"<br>&#160&#160&#160&#160&#160&#160&#160&#160&#160&#160&#160&#160✿ ✿ ✿<br>The music started playing, and all the ballerinas began dancing. Every seat in the audience was full. The ballerinas danced gracefully along with the music. Hope ran across the stage and leaped. She led the others in pointe at the center. Hope's dad sat in the front row, tears of joy in his eyes. Hope twirled in the center as the ballet performance came to a close. Her dad stood up and bursted into applause.<br>&#160&#160&#160&#160&#160&#160&#160&#160&#160&#160&#160&#160✿ ✿ ✿<br>In a diner open late at night, Hope's dad was busy at work.",
    "He mopped the floor, cooked the food, and cleaned the tables.<br>\"Hello?\" a woman sitting in a booth called. \"My burger has onions in it. I specifically asked for no onions.\"<br>\"I apologise,\" Hope's dad responded. \"I'll get you a new one right away.\"<br>He sighed as he finished preparing the burger.<br>Later in the night, he checked out groceries for a customer in a supermarket. He swept the floor and cleaned the isles too.<br>\"Richard, could I talk to you in my office?\" the manager said as he came up to him.<br>\"Yes, of course.\" he replied.<br>They entered the office, and the manager sat down.",
    "\"Well, you've been coming late to work recently,\" he began. \"And you've been slacking in your work performance. What's been going on?\"<br>\"I have a daughter. I need to take care of her.\" Richard explained. \"Plus, I have another job.\"<br>\"I think you're taking on more than you can handle,\" the manager said calmly. \"So, I am with no other choice but to relieve you from this job. You've been a brilliant employee.\"<br>\"I really need the money, please dont—\"<br>\"I have no other choice. I'm sorry.\"<br>\"Thank you for the opportunity.\" He walked out of the manager's office and to a park. There, he sat down and started crying.",
    "&#160&#160&#160&#160&#160&#160&#160&#160&#160&#160&#160&#160✿ ✿ ✿<br>The next day, Hope was performing ballet at the park. Her hat was placed upside-down on the floor for donations. A blond-haired boy placed a dollar bill in her hat.<br>\"You're really talented,\" he told her. \"You know that, right?\"<br>\"Oh, thanks…\" Hope blushed.<br>\"Uh, I'm Noah.\"<br>\"Hope.\"<br>\"Pretty name.\" Noah said.<br>\"Yeah, my dad says it's special.\"<br>\"Mhm.\"<br>\"Well, nice meeting you, Noah. I have to go now…\" Hope said.<br>\"Nice meeting you too.\"<br>Hope walked away, still smiling and blushing.<br>&#160&#160&#160&#160&#160&#160&#160&#160&#160&#160&#160&#160✿ ✿ ✿<br>\"Bye Lucy,\" Hope's dad called to his coworker at the diner. \"I'll see you tomorrow.\"",
    "\"See you, stay safe.\" Lucy replied. He went outside and began walking home. He looked around, feeling slighly uncomfortable. He continued, but was interrupted.<br>\"Stay where you are,\" a man behind him said. He wore a beanie and goggles, holding a gun pointed directly at Richard. Hope's dad turned around.<br>\"Look, I-I don't want any trouble,\" he told the gunman.<br>\"You aren't going to get any,\" the gunman threatened. \"As long as you give me what I want.\"<br>Tears welled up in his eyes as Hope's dad handed him a few dollar bills.<br>\"You're joking, right?\" the gunman said.",
    "\"It's all I have,\" Richard looked down at the floor. \"I work at a diner, I have a child…I don't have much…\"<br>\"Boohoo, cry me a river. There's an ATM <i>right there</i>,\" the gunman said, his gun still pointed at him. \"Take out some money or I'll put a bullet through your head.\"<br>\"I barely have any money in my account. I have <i>nothing</i>…\" he said. The gunman shoved him, but Richard punched him in the face and knocked him over. The gun fell out of his hands, and Richard quickly grabbed it. He pointed it at his attacker.<br>\"I know you won't do it,\" the gunman smirked. A gun went off loudly, but it wasn't the one Richard held. Hope's dad looked down at his chest, and fell to his knees.",
    "Another gunman stood behind him, watching Richard collapse. The two gunmen walked away, leaving him on the floor. Richard's life flashed before his eyes.<br><br>He remembered the day he met her at the park, her bright red hair, and the day he proposed to her, and when…<br>\"I'm sorry to say this but…\" the doctor told him all those years ago.<br>His memories of his wife came flooding back to him. Memories of her when she was pregnant…and her grave too. When she left this world.<br>\"…Your wife died during childbirth.\"",
    "He recalled the happy ones too, of the baby, of Hope growing up, learning how to ride a bike…All those bittersweet memories…<br><br>Lucy walked out of the diner, looking around after hearing the gunshot. Her eyes grew wide as she saw him and called for help.<br>&#160&#160&#160&#160&#160&#160&#160&#160&#160&#160&#160&#160✿ ✿ ✿<br>Back at home, Hope woke up with a strange feeling.<br>\"Dad?\" she called as she headed down stairs. \"Hmmm…I guess he's working a long shift.\"<br>Hope walked to school. During class, the intercom went off.<br>\"Hope Moore, please come to the principal's office.\"<br>Hope left and opened the door to the office. The principal sat at his desk, looking very concerned.",
    "\"Yes, sir? Why did you call me?\" Hope sat down, looking worried. \"I didn't do anything!\"<br>\"It's not about school…\" the principal said, not sure how to begin.<br>\"Then what is it?\"<br>\"Your dad…\"<br>\"Yeah, I was wondering about him, he wasn't at home—\"<br>\"Hope. Your dad is in the hospital…\"<br>\"What?! WHY?\" Hope cried, tears welling up in her eyes.<br>\"He was shot in the back. We're going to get you to the hospital now.\"<br>\"Is-is he okay?\"<br>\"We don't know yet…\" the principal told her. Hope sobbed in her hands while the principal watched her, not knowing how to comfort her.",
    "&#160&#160&#160&#160&#160&#160&#160&#160&#160&#160&#160&#160✿ ✿ ✿<br>Hope held her dad's hand as tears streaked down her cheeks. Her dad had a black eye and his arm was connected to a container of blood. A monitor beeped in the background, keeping track of his heart rate. He opened his eyes slightly.<br>\"Hope…\" her dad said. He was hit with an old memory of them.<br><br>Hope was doing homework while he washed the dishes.<br>\"Hey, Dad? Why did you name me Hope?\" she had asked.<br>\"Well,\" he responded. \"Your mom left us really early.\"<br>It had hurt him to recall the pain Hope's mom had gone through. He had fallen to his knees when he heard the doctor's unforgettable words.",
    "\"You never got to meet her, but she was the prettiest woman you'd ever see.\" Hope's dad had told her. \"I was heartbroken, but when I looked at you, I knew.\"<br>His eyes filled with tears as he washed the dishes. \"Your name is Hope, because hope is what you give me.\"<br>Hope blushed as she looked at her dad from across the room, her eyes brimming with tears.<br><br>\"Dad…?\" Hope glanced at her dad with a worried look. The monitor's beeps began to slow down. He smiled at Hope, and closed his eyes. Hope's heart dropped in her chest.<br>\"Dad…\" Tears spilled from her eyes as she gently shook his arm. \"Please…don't go…\"",
    "No response. The smile on her dad's face faded away.<br>\"No…\" Hope muttered. The sound from the monitor beeped without pausing. She collapsed in her chair, streams of tears falling non-stop.<br>&#160&#160&#160&#160&#160&#160&#160&#160&#160&#160&#160&#160✿ ✿ ✿<br>The pain in her chest never left.

    "<heading><b>Introduction</b></heading><br><b><i>Nunners' Guide To Dreams & Nightmares</i> is a stupid book that shouldn't be taken seriously</b>. If you're shocked or mad about what your dreams tell about you, just know it's probably not true. Don't think I'm diagnosing you or anything. Anyways, the <i>things-you-see-in-your-dreams</i> are sorted in alphabetical order. Meanings created by me except a few (see credits at the last page). And uh if you dreamt or had a nightmare last night don't forget to look for its meaning here.<br><br>Well, I hope you enjoy it!<br>— Nunners",
    "<heading><b>A</b></heading><br><b>Ants</b><br>If you dreamt you were being killed/trampled by a ton of ants, it shows that you're too weak/scared to even step on an ant lol. If you were dreaming about watching ants, you probably really like ants 'cause I don't know who dreams of ants…<br><br><b>Animal</b><br><i>See Ants/Bears/Bees/Cows/<br>Giraffes/Jellyfish/Koalas/<br>Lizards/Octopi/Quails</i>",
    "<heading><b>B</b></heading><br><b>Bears</b><br>If you dreamt that a bear attacked/killed you, you probably <i>won't</i> be attacked by a bear in the future. Ah, scratch that. Everyone's gonna be mauled to death by a bear in the near future (thanks to <i>Bears Want To Kill You</i> by Ethan Nicole). If you've been attacked by a bear in the past, your nightmare was probably just a cute little memory of the past, don't worry about it. Yeah…<br><br><b>Bees</b><br>If you dreamt that you were being swarmed by bees, it may be a result from a bad memory from the past relating to bees.",
    "<heading><b>B</b></heading><br><b>Bees (cont.)</b><br>Same goes for dreaming about being stung by one/many. If you had a nice dream about petting cute bees, then good for you since 12.5% of all people are terrified by them.<br><br><b>Burgers</b><br>If you dreamed about burgers then you're probably really obsessed with burgers. If you dream of burgers or any other junk food several more times this week, then you may develop obesity (no kidding this time). If you dreamt that someone stole your burger then oh no someone's gonna steal your burger today :C",
    "<heading><b>B</b></heading><br><b>Bulls</b><br>Bro what in the world you doin' dreaming about bulls????",
    "<heading><b>C</b></heading><br><b>Cheeseburgers</b><br><i>See Burgers</i><br><br><b>Cows</b><br>If you dreamt about cows, it could be because you ate some Chick-fil-a yesterday. If you didn't, then it probably means you really like cows for some reason. In many cultures, cows are considered sacred, so something really epic may happen to you soon. If you were dreaming that you got reincarnated as a cow, then maybe you read <i>I Got Reincarnated As A Cow</i> a bit too much. If you constantly dream of turning into a cow, then it's very likely that you <i>will</i> become one when you die. If you dreamt about male cows (called bulls get it right), then <i>see Bulls</i>.",
    "<heading><b>D</b></heading><br><b>Death</b><br>If you dreamt that you died, then you probably woke up right after (omg you did 😱). If you dreamt that someone you care about died, then uh oh <i>something similar might just happen</i> 👀",
    "<heading><b>E</b></heading><br><b>Egg</b><br>If you dreamt about cooked eggs, then you probably really want eggs for breakfast. Chances are, if you already ate breakfast, there weren't any eggs in it. Too bad.",
    "<heading><b>F</b></heading><br><b>Falling</b><br>If you dreamt that you were falling off a high height or into oblivion, there's probably some really big problems bugging you right now. But if you dreamt off falling off a high height on <i>purpose</i>, then…that's a different story…(<i>see Suicide</i>)",
    "<heading><b>G</b></heading><br><b>Giraffes</b><br>If you dreamt about giraffes, your neck will grow 5% longer than normal every month starting tomorrow 🦒.",
    "<heading><b>H</b></heading><br><b>Hamburgers</b><br><i>See Burgers</i>",
    "<heading><b>I</b></heading><br><b>Ice Cream</b><br>If you dreamt about ice cream, it shows that you look for all the sweetest things in life. I hope you didn't just eat ice cream for breakfast right now.",
    "<heading><b>J</b></heading><br><b>Jellyfish</b><br>If you dreamt about jellyfish, it shows you may look all cute on the outside, but you're actually really stingy on the inside.",
    "<heading><b>K</b></heading><br><b>Koalas</b><br>If you dreamt about koalas, you probably really want to go back to sleep right now. Maybe you're jealous they get to sleep so much and you're just here trying to stay awake.",
    "<heading><b>L</b></heading><br><b>Lizards</b><br>If you dreamt lizards, then there's probably lizards in your backyard right now. If you don't have a backyard, then you probably enjoy watching lizards skitter across sidewalks or something. Or they're being annoying pests where you frequently go to. If none of these apply to you, then you're probably just dying to see a lizard in-person.",
    "<heading><b>M</b></heading><br><b>Mad</b><br>If you dreamt about being mad at someone/some people you know (a friend, someone who lives with you), then you probably had an argument or fight recently (bro no way 😱). From the looks of it, the argument didn't end well because one person may have just stormed off or hurt someone (could be you). The best thing you and the people involved should do is ✨✨make up✨✨ and ✨✨apologise✨✨.",
    "<heading><b>N</b></heading><br><b>Net</b><br>If you dreamt about being caught in a net, it probably shows that you're tangled up in a problem that's been bothering you lately. If you were dreaming that you used a net to capture something, it shows that you like taking advantage of others, even if you may not realize it. Unless you trap animals for a living or something, and you were just doing so in your sleep. Otherwise, now's a good time to stop trapping animals for your Serenitea Pot.",
    "<heading><b>O</b></heading><br><b>Octopi</b><br>If you dreamt about octopi (or octopuses, whatever), maybe it's 'cause you saw/ate some recently. Like, you went to Sea World on the weekend or ate Takoyaki yesterday. But if you didn't, it shows that sometimes you just wanna camouflage with your surroundings or really want eight arms. I don't really think that's a problem, but if none of these apply to you then…you have a secret liking for octopi (that you may or may not realize) 🐙",
    "<heading><b>P</b></heading><br><b>Penguins</b><br>If you dreamt about penguins, then you have some crazy obsession over them (yeah <i>anton</i>). But if you're clearly aware that you do <i>not</i> have some crazy obsession over penguins, then this shows that you like the cold or waddle when you walk lol.",
    "<heading><b>Q</b></heading><br><b>Quails</b><br>If you dreamt about quails, then it shows you're a social person. Chances are, you're also shorter than the average person your age. You also groom yourself frequently. But maybe not many people know about your true personality. You could probably shoot lazers out of your hairline or something. If you dreamt about your <i>pet</i> quail (if any), then you dreamt about it 'cause it's your pet duhh. Otherwise, you really want a pet quail and dreamt of petting it or something.",
    "<heading><b>R</b></heading><br><b>Running</b><br>If you dreamt about running (like for fun), then it shows you like running (and maybe you didn't realize it). If you were running in your dream without reason and you know you hate running, you probably ran a lot or for a long distance recently. If you dreamt of running away from someone like a bad guy, then it shows you're always trying to avoid or forget your problems (especially big ones if any). So then you should <b>stop</b> avoiding them and be present. Resolve them, it's never too late to do so 😃👍!! (unless you forgot to turn in your homework and your teacher does not accept late work)",
    "<heading><b>R</b></heading><br><b>Running (cont.)</b><br>If you dreamt that you were running away (from home, the police etc.) then it shows that <i>something happened</i> in real life that lead to this (omg no way 🤯). If you were dreaming that you ran away from home, then maybe your parents aren't being parent-ly irl…or maybe just in the dream. It's like that sometimes. If you were dreaming that you were running away from the cops, then you probably commited a crime in the dream (or in real life…). If you're completely innocent (irl), then maybe you have that devious side to you that had only been brought out in a dream (just a thought).",
    "<heading><b>S</b></heading><br><b>Suicide</b><br>If you dreamt that you commit suicide, then you should attend some suicide counseling, I don't really know what to tell you—But if you were dreaming that someone you know/care about did, then uhhhh maybe tell them that you're there for them…? You may be forseeing the future or reading their thoughts somehow. 👀",
    "<heading><b>T</b></heading><br><b>Teeth</b><br>If you dreamt that a tooth fell out, then one of your teeth will most likely come out soon (if you still got baby teeth). If one/all of your teeth came out in your dream and you have all permanent teeth, then you're probably gonna lose something soon (it probably won't be just teeth).",
    "<heading><b>U</b></heading><br><b>Umbrellas</b><br>If you dreamt about umbrellas, then you probably used one recently (for blocking rain or heat). If you didn't, then maybe you or someone else bought you a new umbrella recently. The umbrella must've been really fascinating for you to dream about it, huh?",
    "<heading><b>V</b></heading><br><b>Vases</b><br>If you dreamt about vases, then you probably like buying flower bouquets and stuffing them in vases filled with water (sorry I made it sound bad). Maybe yesterday was Valentine's or Mother's Day, and you or someone else living with you got a flower bouquet and \"vased\" it. You probably sniffed or examined the flowers for long enough to dream about them. Or it's someone's wedding anniversary or baby shower and you were in charge of adding the centerpieces.",
    "<heading><b>W</b></heading><br><b>Whales</b><br>If you dreamt about whales, then you probably had a presentation at school on whales. But you probably didn't. If you dreamt of whales, you were most likely amazed at them giants at like Sea World or researched them for fun.",
    "<heading><b>X</b></heading><br><b>Xylophones</b><br>If you dreamt about xylophones (coming soon)",
    "<heading><b>Y</b></heading><br><b>Yelling</b><br>If you dreamt about yelling (coming soon)",

    "Year before, Hope stood with her dad at her mother's gravestone. Her grave was next to a beautiful water fountain. She placed a fresh bouquet of white roses in front of it. After some time of mourning, they walked down the path towards the exit of the graveyard.<br>Hope held her dad's hand. \"What color was her hair?\"<br>\"Red, just like yours,\" he responded.<br>\"I wish I could have met her…\"<br>\"I wish you could have too,\" her dad sighed. \"She was just like you, you know. She wanted to be a ballerina too, professionally.\"<br>\"But why didn't she?\"",
    "\"Well, she gave that all up for you,\" he smiled. \"She had plans to go back to college and so did I.\"<br>\"Daddy,\" Hope looked down at the ground.<br>\"What's wrong?\"<br>\"Did I kill her, Daddy?\" Hope looked at her dad, eyes full of tears.<br>\"Oh my gosh, of course not.\" He hugged her as she sobbed into his arms.<br><br>&#160&#160&#160&#160&#160&#160&#160&#160&#160&#160&#160&#160✿ ✿ ✿<br><br>The memories in Hope's heart were still so vivid. The endless ring of the monitor next to her dad's hospital bed. The white flower she placed on top of his coffin. Her dad giving her the white flower before her recital.",
    "The time she walked with him when she was little, and the time she rode a bike for the first time. The last hug he ever gave her before saying goodbye. Her dad applauding for her after the performance. And the ride to the orphanage.<br><br>In a bathroom stall, Hope was panicking, breathing heavily. Noah walked in.<br>\"Hope? Everyone's looking for you,\" Noah said.<br>\"I-I can't do this…\" Hope told him, tears already forming in her eyes.<br>\"Of course you can. You've been practicing for weeks.\" He tried cheering her up.<br>\"No, I can't.\" She looked down at the floor of the stall. \"Not without my dad…\"",
    "Noah sighed and leaned his arm against Hope's stall. \"I know how you feel, trust me.\"<br>Hope's breathing suddenly became heavy and uneven. She looked up at Noah who stood in front of the door. \"I-I think I'm having a panic attack—\"<br>\"Oh—uhhh…t-try breathing slowly,\" Noah suggested.<br>\"I'm trying, it's not working—\"<br>\"Then, try counting to ten with me. I'll help you.\" he reassured. \"Okay, one…\"<br>\"Two…\"<br>\"Three…\"<br><br>Hope performs a pirouette, comepletely calm. Noah sat at the front of the audience and blushed at how talented she was. Hope looked at him and blushed too.",
    "&#160&#160&#160&#160&#160&#160&#160&#160&#160&#160&#160&#160✿ ✿ ✿<br><br>Late in the evening in Sarah's Orphanage, kids were watching TV, eating dinner, and playing outside in the backyard. Outside, Hope sat with Noah on one of the tall structures.<br>\"You were really good earlier!\" Noah smiled.<br>\"Thanks,\" she replied.<br>Noah looked at the ground below with a frown. Hope was quick to notice his feelings.<br>\"Hey, what's wrong?\"<br>\"Oh, nothing. I was just…thinking.\"<br>\"You don't need to lie.\" Hope smiled at him. \"I'm here for you.\"<br>Hope took his hand and Noah looked up at her. \"…Always\" she added.",
    "\"…I-I—\" he stammered. \"I was thinking about my dad.\"<br>Hope remembered they were in an orphanage. \"What was he like?\"<br>\"Well…that's the thing,\" Noah said. \"I…don't know. I never met him.\"<br>Noah winced at the thought. \"They said he dumped me here in a wooden basket. Moses style, with a note.\"<br>\"Wait…what happened to the note?\"<br>\"I have it here. They gave it to me a few months ago when I turned 15.\"<br>\"I don't know if it's too personal to ask, but could I see it?\" Hope asked.<br>\"Yeah…sure.\" Noah searched through his pockets and pulled out a small piece of paper. It read, \"<i>Do not try to find me…Noah is better off without me.</i>\"",
    "\"Noah…\" Hope began. \"I only came here a few months ago. Is this why you were so upset?\"<br>\"I…\" Tears welled up in his eyes. \"I just get sad sometimes, you know? When I have football practice, I look at the crowd to see if someone is holding a sign for me, someone cheering me on, someone that loves me…\"<br>He paused. \"I see no one.<br>\"Parent-teacher conferences come along, and I come with my freaking social worker while everyone's with their mom and dad.\"<br>A tear rolled down his cheek. \"I'm sorry…I just…\"<br>\"No, let it out,\" Hope told him. Noah closed his eyes.<br>\"Sometimes it just hits me. I…I have no one. Nobody…\"",
    "Hope gave him a reassuring hug and he began to cry. \"You have me,\" she said. Noah didn't say anything and sobbed in her arms.<br><br>&#160&#160&#160&#160&#160&#160&#160&#160&#160&#160&#160&#160✿ ✿ ✿<br><br>The next day, Hope held her textbooks in her arms through the school entrance. Suddenly, a familiar black-haired girl and her friends walked up to her.<br>\"Hah, look which freak decided to come to our school.\"<br>She quickly poured water on the floor in front of her. Hope didn't even have time to realize what was going on before she slipped.<br>\"Oops…sorry,\" the girl said, looking down at her. The three of them laughed.<br>\"I-It's okay…\" Hope said.",
    "She walked away ashamed as the girls continued to laugh at her.<br>\"Annie?\" the blond-haired one called towards Hope. Hope turned towards her with her head still down. The girls became amused.<br>\"Annie, is that you?\" she called again.<br>\"No, my name is Hope…\" she said.<br>\"No, I mean Annie, from the movie? The orphan?\" the girl smirked. \"You know her right?\"<br>\"I-I…\" Hope tried holding back the tears forming in her eyes, but she couldn't. She ran off crying, the three bullies laughing wildly.<br><br>Later at lunchtime, Hope looked around to find a seat. A shaggy-haired boy sitting in one of the tables looked over at her.<br>\"Is that her?\" he sneered.",
    "The mean girls from earlier sat nearby.<br>\"Yep,\" said the leader.<br>\"I'll be right back,\" he stood up. The bullies watched with a cold grin.<br>Hope looked at them in confusion. The boy walked up to Hope and slammed her food out of her hands.<br>\"Oops, my bad, haha,\" he looked down at the ruined food on the floor.<br>Hope bent down to pick it back up when he stepped all over it before she had the chance. She looked up sadly at the boy, tears already emerging. Hope only had a few seconds to see Noah running towards them and punching the boy.<br>\"Do you think you're funny?\" he glared at him.",
    "Blood oozed out from his nose because of the impact. The shaggy-haired kid just laughed at him. In the blink of an eye, he shoved Noah to the ground and started kicking his face. All the other students in the cafeteria gaped at the two boys fighting.<br>The principal stormed in. \"Both of you to the nurse's office now!\" he yelled. \"And make sure you pay my office a visit once you're done!\"<br><br>&#160&#160&#160&#160&#160&#160&#160&#160&#160&#160&#160&#160✿ ✿ ✿<br><br>Hope held an ice pack against Noah's head. He was still in bad shape after the fight, with a black eye and bruises.<br>\"You didn't have to do that, you know.\" Hope sighed at the condition of his face.",
    "\"I did,\" Noah said. \"I couldn't stand you being treated like that.\"<br>A tear fell down Hope's eye.<br>\"Why are you crying?\" he asked worriedly.<br>\"I've just never had someone care for me like you do, since…\" Hope's face turned red. \"Well, you know…\"<br>Noah smiled. \"Well, I—\"<br>Hope leaned forward and kissed him.<br><br>&#160&#160&#160&#160&#160&#160&#160&#160&#160&#160&#160&#160✿ ✿ ✿<br><br>The next day, Hope sat at a policeman's desk. Her social worker sat at one end of the room.<br>\"Hope, we have disappointing news about the investigation of you father,\" the policeman said with a concerned look.",
    "\"W-What is it?\" Hope said anxiously.<br>\"Well…\"<br>\"TELL ME. Don't sugarcoat it.\"<br>\"The surveillance cameras on that street were broken, as the street was so run-down. Therefore, we cannot find enough evidence to rule your father's death as a murder.\"<br>\"What?\" she looked at him like he was crazy.<br>He continued. \"The wounds appear to be self-inflicted—\"<br>\"What abount the blood?\" Hope said in a panic. \"The witness? <i>Anything?!</i>\"<br>\"According to the breathalyzer, the witness had been drinking that night, so they're an invalid witness.\"<br>The policeman took a deep breath.",
    "\"I'm sorry to say this, but we've come to the conclusion…that your father killed himself.\"<br>\"No…no…\" Hope couldn't bear what she was hearing.<br>\"I'm very sorry, you have my condolences. It may be hard to accept—\"<br>\"It can't be…\" she looked up at the policeman.<br>\"We have a helpline ready for you to call if you're feeling—\"<br>Hope put her fists down on his desk. \"NO! My father didn't kill himself.\"<br>She stared at him defiantly. \"He worked and he worked to support us, to support <i>me</i>. He would come home late after a shift and still use whatever little energy he had left to cook me dinner.\"<br>A tear ran down her face.",
    "\"He gave <i>everything</i> for me. He would <i>NEVER</i> kill himself.\" She took off, leaving the policeman feeling guilty.<br>\"Hope, wait!\" her social worker stood up hurriedly.<br><br>Hope sat curled up by a bush in the park. Her eyes were still wet from crying. She reminisced a time her dad had placed a bandage on her knee when she scraped it during ballet.<br>\"Never give up in what you believe in,\" he told her then. \"Remember that, okay?\"<br>\"I will,\" she responded. Hope remembered that she had cried when she had gotten injured, and that it was her dad who cheered her up.<br>She had a determined look on her face.",
    "\"I will get my dad justice,\" she stated.<br>Hope walked down the street near the diner her dad used to work at. It was late at night, so it looked abandoned. She turned and pictured her dad on the ground there with tears in his eyes. Before she knew it, someone appeared in front of her.<br>\"Oh, sweetie,\" said a man dressed in all black. He wore a beanie and goggles and his voice sounded cold and sarcastic.<br>\"You shouldn't be on these streets this late at night.\"<br>Hope didn't say anything and did not take her eyes off the object he held. It was a gun.<br>\"You did it…didn't you?\" Hope murmured, trying to keep the fear out of her voice.",
    "\"Did what?\" the gunman asked, acting as if he had no clue.<br>\"You killed my father…\" Hope began to get irritated at him.<br>\"I don't know what you're talking about, sweetie.\" he replied in an annoying voice.<br>Hope couldn't contain it anymore. \"STOP CALLING ME THAT!\" she screamed in his face.<br>The man took off his goggles and his face was tense. He pointed his gun at her.<br>\"You might want to reduce your volume,\" the gunman said heatedly. \"Or things are gonna get really bloody.\"<br>He tilted his head a little and smiled bitterly. \"You wouldn't want that, do you, <i>sweetie?</i>\"<br>\"I said <i>STOP!!</i>\" Hope yelled, infuriated.<br>Suddenly, he fired at her.",
    "Hope braced for impact just as someone jumped in front of her. Hope fell down to her knees in tears to see Noah on the ground, who had saved her life. Tears streaked down Noah's face, which never fully healed yet. The bullet had hit him directly in the chest and he was bleeding badly.<br>\"NO!\" she panicked. She held him in her arms and could not do anything.<br>All of a sudden there was a clatter of a gun falling on the floor. The gunman's eyes were wide and fear was visible in him.<br>\"Noah?\"<br>He clearly remembered the time he surrendered Noah in a basket to the orphanage. He placed a teddy bear, baby bottle, and a note to the caretakers inside.",
    "He fought back the tears, but it was for the best…<br>Noah looked up at the gunman weakly.<br>\"D-Dad?\"<br><br><i>Hope Vol. 3</i> coming in June 2023!",

    "The nurses quickly escorted Noah to the surgery room in the hospital. Hope followed behind them.<br><i>There are times in life when you're tested</i>, she thought, <i>When you feel like the world is out to get you.<br>She looked at Noah with the bullet hole in his chest.<br><i>…And you feel like there's nothing you can possibly do.

    "She clearly remembered her dad's smile fading as the heart rate monitor signaled asystole, and her uncontrollable break down when he died.

    "I was still half asleep when my dad shook me awake at 5 am.<br>\"C'mon, Eve, wake up! We're gonna hike up the trail without you!\"<br>I groaned. It was clearly still dark outside. \"It's so early…Do we <i>have</i> to?\"<br>\"Of course!\" He leaned closer to me as if to tell me a secret. \"And besides, you already know Sarah's been dying to see the view. Let's go!\"<br>He waited outside. Not this about Sarah again. She's Dad's girlfriend, and this trip was meant to be a \"bonding experience\" for us. I changed clothes against my will and got out of the tent. My stomach grumbled. Dad said we would be eating breakfast during the hike. But I wanted food <i>now</i>…",
    "I could see the \"Silver Woods Main Trail\" sign ahead and Sarah waving at me. Literally all the other campers were still asleep in their tents. I was close to freezing <i>and</i> starving to death, so I ignored her and tried to keep warm. Dad must've noticed because he gestured me towards her.<br>\"Hey, don't be rude, Evie.\" I glanced at him when he said that. He never called me that, not since Mom died… \"She's got a gift for you. Go say hi.\"<br>I walked towards her. Sarah looked nothing like Mom, with short, black hair and an excited grin all the time. Mom had dirty-blond hair like mine and was always calm.<br>\"Hey, Eve!\"",
    "\"Can I see the gift Dad mentioned?\" I walked ahead of her impatiently. The path was already getting uneven. <i>I hope she trips</i>, I thought. I realized that the idea seemed to be going overboard. I shook it away. Her gift better be a hot stack of pancakes.<br>\"Here,\" Sarah caught up with me and wrapped something around my neck. \"Ooh, it fits!\"<br>\"Hey, what're you—!\" It was a light brown scarf. Surprisingly, it was cozy, but I tried to look like I didn't care.<br>\"It bring out your eyes.\" She smiled at me.<br>\"Sure, whatever.\"<br>We started to walk. I could hear Dad trying to catch up from behind.",
    "Sarah had one of those moments when she remembered something big.<br>I didn't really want to engage in a conversation with her, but she just started talking.<br>\"Hey, have you heard? It's rumored that this forest has a secret grove somewhere far away.\" My curiosity got the best of me. Sure, the rumor sounded stupid, but I looked up at her in spite of myself.<br>\"It's called Charcoal Grove. Legend has it that phoenixes once lived there. Apparently, they've all disappeared.\"<br>The surrounding trees were looming over us. Their branches shook in the breeze. From below, the trees looked like giant skeletons in the darkness.",
    "The path was only visible from the steak lights beside the fences. I wondered if Dad brought a flashlight, but then I totally forgot that I could use my phone's. My pockets were empty. I guess I left it back at the tent.<br>\"Every last one of them?\" I asked Sarah. She shrugged.<br>\"Who knows? But, if you do see one, could you take a photo of it for me?\"<br>\"Yeah, maybe.\"<br>She grinned at me and left to walk with Dad. She really was different from Mom, considering how much she smiled. I looked back at her. Dad was talking with Sarah, and she laughed and clutched onto his arm. I quickly turned away from them and angered boiled inside of me.",
    "<i>How could Dad be so happy with her?</i> I kicked at a rock like a soccer ball to keep me occupied. Mom couldn't be replaced. It started to get even colder, so I wrapped the scarf around me tighter when Sarah wasn't looking. But I couldn't just tell him to stop liking her. That wasn't how it worked.<br>I didn't speak at all as we continued the trail. It was like it got steeper with every step I took. Looking up, the sun must've started to rise a little. The trail wound up to the top of a mountain. I tried to eavesdrop on Dad and his girlfriend, but then I accidentally kicked the rock over the fence. It fell far and disappeared in the field of trees below. It was as if the trees weren't affected from the impact.",
    "I guess no matter how much I convinced Dad, he wouldn't break up with Sarah. When we reached the top, I sat on a bench and regained my breath. Dad's girlfriend went close to the edge and was in total awe. It really was a stunning view from the top. The sun was rising and it painted the sky with orange hues. The hike must've taken more than an hour, because I was <i>really</i> tired.<br>\"Need a drink?\" Dad plopped down beside me. He handed me his water flask and I was about to chug the whole thing if he hadn't stopped me. He also gave me his sandwich. I was so caught up in my thoughts that I must've forgotten mine. I took a bite but I forgot my hunger. I re-wrapped and pocketed the sandwich.",
    "I stood up and walked towards the lookout. Looking down over the fence, the forest rolled for miles over hills and mountains. Sarah was taking a hundred photos in all sorts of angles, some including herself.<br>\"Want to take a photo with me?\" she flipped her phone camera around so that it faced the two of us.<br>\"Ehh, I'm not into that kinda stuff…\" I cringed slightly and walked away. Dad suddenly jogged up to me like he was gonna pee his pants.<br>\"Hey, uhh Eve, could you do me a favor?\" He eyed Sarah quickly. Whatever this \"favor\" was, there was a 99% chance this was going to involve <i>her</i>.",
    "\"I…totally forgot to take photos of the trees on the way here. Here, can you take some for me?\"<br>Dad handed me his phone like he was in a hurry. He pushed me a little. \"Oh, and, can you get pictures of the view of the trees back there? Thanks.\"<br><i>What was <i>that</i> all about?</i> I thought, heading back towards the trail. I opened the camera on his phone and took a couple photos that showed the trees plus the pretty sky. I walked a little more to get the pics Dad specifically asked me to get. They literally looked just like the photos I took earlier. Why did he make me take a <i>walk</i> then? I lost my train of thought when a squirrel appeared from behind a bush. It stared directly at me, then towards the lookout.",
    "Just to be funny, I recorded it. It held its gaze for so long, I had an idea about catching it. I decided to turn around to see what the little guy had been so captivated at. From the distance, I could see the silhouette of Dad, who was unusually close to Sarah. I heard the squirrel scamper away. I moved in closer and hid behind a tree, peeking out.<br><i>Oh no. Ohhhhh no.</i> I could see him reaching for something in his pocket. <i>No…th—there's no way—</i> He suddenly got on one knee and proposed to her. It was obvious. Sarah's hands covered her mouth. The ring was glittering in the morning sun. I wanted to run over there and break up what was going on, but I was too late.",
    "I bet she said \"yes\" because Dad slid the ring on her finger and th—they—(I'm not gonna say the word, I don't want to)<br>I was totally furious from being tricked. Of course Dad would find some excuse to get me to leave for this, especially since I didn't like Sarah. This woman can't replace Mom…no, never. I deleted all the photos I took including the squirrel video. But I could only stare at them helplessly.<br>\"Sarah's going to be your mom soon.\" I nearly jumped from the sight of Dad and his new fiancé. I probably started staring off into space. Sarah showed me her engagement ring as if I wasn't watching the whole thing.",
    "\"Oh yeah. Here's your phone, Dad.\" I handed it back to him and the two of them began to head back. Dad looked at me like he was a little irritated. I was afraid of how my life would be different now. But I didn't have a choice and had to follow them.<br><br>&#160&#160&#160&#160&#160&#160&#160&#160&#160&#160&#160&#160〜 🏹 〜<br><br>I didn't talk for a while on our way back. I mostly glared at Dad from behind, who had his arm around Sarah. No way I'm calling her \"mom.\" After a while I couldn't take it anymore.<br>I ran up to Dad and tapped him on the shoulder. \"Are you sure you're making the right decision?\"",
    "He looked at me like I was insane. \"Of course.\" He must've remembered that Sarah was right next to him. \"I love Sarah. Don't you?\"<br>I managed to stifle a laugh. \"You're joking, right?\"<br>Sarah gasped. Dad looked at me seriously. \"Eve Sheryl Clark, you take that back <i>right now</i>!\"<br>\"NO!\" I took a couple steps back. \"You…You can't just replace Mom like that—\"<br>\"That's not what I meant,\" Dad said sternly. He looked at Sarah. \"I'm sorry about that, please don't listen to her.\"<br>\"It's alright,\" she looked at me empathetically and placed her hand on my shoulder. I couldn't hold it in. I tore her hand away from me. \"Don't touch me!\"",
    "Maybe I did seem insane. I glared at Dad. \"How could you forget about Mom?\" I choked back tears. It felt hard to swallow. \"Just because Mom died doesn't meant—\"<br>\"Don't you dare talk about that!\" Dad looked like he was gonna strangle me.<br>\"Why? Are you afraid of Mom's death? She died from cancer when I was five.\" I sounded grave. My vision got all watery.<br>\"Eve! You get over here right—!\"<br>Sarah grabbed my hand gently. \"Evie…\"<br>I gave her a horrified look. \"No one calls me Evie, nobody but Mom…\"<br>I suddenly bolted. I could hear them running after me. Dad yelled something, but I was too far away to understand.",
    "I didn't know where I was going. I just kept running. The wind whistled in my ears. The sound of their footsteps disappeared as I ran downhill. Other hikers stared at me when I passed them.<br>My life flashed through my eyes. I remembered Mom's calm smile and soothing voice. That one time we went to the park with Dad. That other time when we all went camping for the first time. Even the time Dad cried for the first time when he was told the news about Mom's cancer. I recalled having no friends at school, even now. After holding back tears of anger and sadness for so long, they were finally able to escape.<br>At one point I started to slow down. It dawned on me that the path was totally gone. I stopped and looked around.",
    "I only heard the song of crickets and the water of a nearby brook. The sun was fully out. I must've ran so far that I didn't know where I ended up in. I had no idea what was in store for me.",
