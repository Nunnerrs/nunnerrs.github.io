Books should be read from left to right, top to bottom. To open a book, click on any button (book cover) under a book genre (close any open books first). Each book is sorted into a category/genre (e.g. click on Nunnerology under Non-Fiction). Books with \"Vol. 1\", \"Vol. 2\", etc under the title means that book is part of a series. If you're going to start a book series, you should always read each book in order (start with Volume 1, then read Volume 2‚Ä¶) so you understand the storyline.",
        "The Reading Level on the cover shows the \"difficulty\" of the currently open book. It's out of 5 stars, <star>‚òÖ‚òÜ‚òÜ‚òÜ‚òÜ</star> means the book is very easy to read while <star>‚òÖ‚òÖ‚òÖ‚òÖ‚òÖ</star> means the book may be pretty difficult to read (because of the vocabulary). Don't worry if you like reading books 2-stars or less or 4-stars or more, everyone has their likes and dislikes. Most books have a reading level of <star>‚òÖ‚òÖ‚òÖ‚òÜ‚òÜ</star> (moderate level). The book will open up above all the book buttons along will three different buttons. The <span style='font-family: M PLUS ROUNDED 1C'>‚Üê</span> button flips the book one page backward. The <span style='font-family: M PLUS ROUNDED 1C'>&#215</span> button closes the book. The <span style='font-family: M PLUS ROUNDED 1C'>‚Üí</span> button flips the book one page forward.

Many people like using dark mode (pretty much everywhere they can), and the darkness can be easier on eyes (especially at night).

Pinky floats next to him.<br>\"Wow, that looks cool!\" she exclaims. \"Wait, what is it?\"<br>The strange object is shaped like long, purple tubes.<br>\"Maybe‚Ä¶it's an animal?\" Mint guesses. Using one tentacle, he touches the bumpy outside, but nothing happens. Pinky looks at the thing upside down.<br>\"It didn't move, so it's not an animal‚Ä¶\" Mint says.<br>\"Maybe it's a plant,\" Pinky says. \"Can I eat it?\"<br>\"Umm, I don't think you should,\" Mint warns.",
        "He looks inside the tubes from the top. All them are empty. They both circle it many times while thinking.<br>\"It looks like it's stuck to the ground,\" Pinky says. \"Wait, what's <i>this</i>?\"<br>She stops and looks at another strange thing nearby. It's yellow and has branches. Bumps cover the entire thing.<br>\"These look so cool,\" Mint thinks out loud. \"Are they similar?\"<br>\"Where do the roots of the plant go‚Ä¶?\" Pinky says. She tries to pull the yellow thing out. A branch came off easily when Pinky did, and they watched as it fell onto the ground. \"Uh oh‚Ä¶I broke it‚Ä¶\"<br>\"AAH! What if that was a living thing?!\" Mint says in a panic. \"You broke off it's arm!!\"",
        "A small teal fish swims by and looks at the octopi.<br>\"NOO!!\" she cries in a shrilly voice. \"Look what you've done to my pwecious home‚Ä¶\"<br>The fish races to the yellow thing and sighs.<br>\"I-I'm so sowwy, i-it was an accident,\" Pinky stammers.<br>\"Huh?

Anyway, who <i>are</i> you two?\"<br>\"I'm Mint, and she's Pinky,\" Mint says. He tilts his head a little. \"What do you mean by <i>it</i>?\"<br>\"You know, the <i>coral</i>,\" the fish says, swimming into a purple tube. She sticks her head out of it. \"This is my home, in the <i>coral</i> reef.\"",
        "\"Ohhhh,\" Pinky realizes. \"So <i>coral</i> is the name of these things.\"<br>\"So you live in the coral,\" Mint says. \"They really are plants.\"<br>\"No, they aren't,\" the fish says. Pinky's eyes widen. She turned to the yellow branch-like coral<br>\"I'm sowwy, little guy‚Ä¶\" she says. \"Uhh, where's their eyes?\"<br>\"Well, coral aren't fish either,\" says the little fish. \"But they are alive. Oh, did you see the piece that broke off?\"<br>She swims to the broken coral piece on the ground. It stands upright like a tiny cone, while earlier it didn't. \"These yellow ones are called staghorn coral. Look, it's already growing.\"<br>\"Woah‚Ä¶do they multiply that way?\" Mint asks.<br>\"Pretty much!\" the fish says.",
        "\"I've wanted another Staghorn by my home for a while since they've got many branches.\"<br>\"What's this one then?\" Pinky asks, floating beside the purple tube-like coral.<br>\"Those are tube coral,\" she explains.<br>\"I'm hungry. We should really go now‚Ä¶\" Mint says.<br>\"See you again someday! Bye-byeee!!\" Pinky waves a tentacle at the fish.<br>\"Oh, and my name's Liva! Bye!\"<br>Mint and Pinky swim away from the corals, only to see hundreds of more coral below a small cliff in all different colors.<br>\"Wanna go exploring first?\" Mint smiles at Pinky.<br>\"Race ya to that big rock!\" she calls, rushing ahead.",

        "Pinky and Mint swim along the ocean floor. They are octopi. Mint quickly picks up a sea shell on the floor but doesn't find anything inside.<br>\"Haahhhh‚Ä¶\" he sighs. \"All I see are empty shells and rocks. Didn't you say there's snails in these shells?\"<br>\"Hold on, we'll find one somewhere around here‚Ä¶\" Pinky says hopefully. \"We just gotta look harder!\"<br>As they continued their search, Pinky finds a round shell and sees something in it that catches her eye.<br>\"Mint! I found it!!\" she calls.<br>Mint drops the rock he held and swims towards Pinky with excitement.<br>\"Wow‚Ä¶what is it?\"",
        "The red little creature inside the shell doesn't move.<br>\"See? I told you we'd find one!\" Pinky says happily.<br>\"But‚Ä¶what <i>is</i> that?\"<br>\"Uh, it's <i>obviously</i> a <i>snail</i>!\"<br>\"How am I supposed to know?\"<br>The creature twitches as Pinky scoops it into her arms. As they look more closely, it's body looks scaly and dotted with hairs.<br>\"Pfff!\" Mint laughs. \"That's not a snail! That thing's not slimy <i>or</i> squishy!\"<br>\"O-Of course it's a snail!\" Pinky says. She looks down at the shelled creature in her arms. \"Hey there little guy‚Ä¶\"<br>The living thing wiggles as Pinky touches it gently. Both octopi gasp as they realize its \"body\" is actually the creature's legs!",
        "\"WAAUGHH!\" Pinky screams. \"Th-that's NOT a snail‚Äî\"<br>She lets go of the shell and the creature sinks down from her arms onto the floor. Little eyes slowly poke out from the shell and extends its legs.<br>\"Whew‚Ä¶\" the red creature says, shaking sand off of it's body. It looks at the octopi and jumps. \"Yikes!\"<br>The creature quickly digs into the sand to hide, but its shell is still visible.<br>\"Hey, wait!\" Mint cries. He moves a little closer to the frightened creature. \"Umm‚Ä¶lil' crab, we're not here to harm you‚Ä¶\"<br>\"Eek!\" the crab curls up even more into its shell. \"G-Go away‚Ä¶\"<br>\"Hmmm‚Ä¶how do we get them to <i>not</i> be scared‚Ä¶?\" Pinky wonders.",
        "\"Wait, I think I know!\" Mint's eyes light up as he grabs a handful of seaweed and places it in front of the crab. \"Here.\"<br>Moments later, tiny eyes pop out from the shell and stares directly at the seaweed, then to Mint, then to Pinky. Two large claws quickly snatch the seaweed, and the crab munches away at it. It keeps a close eye on the octopi but happily continues to eat.<br>Mint smiles and Pinky does a flip. \"Yippeee!\" Pinky exclaims. She stops and rushes towards the crab. \"Ooh, wait, what's your name, little crabby guy?\"<br>\"Kmmhy,\" The crab mumbles, continues to eat.<br>\"Ummm‚Ä¶what did you say?\" Pinky frowns.",
        "Mint and Pinky watch the little guy eat quietly. After a while, it takes its last bite and swallows. \"Yummy‚Ä¶\" the creature smiles happily. It glances at the two octopi looming over it. \"Oh yeah.\"<br>The crab stands up and stretches, shaking off the sand on its shell. It looks at them with bright eyes. \"My name's Cory. I thought you guys were gonna hurt me or something at first,\" the crab says in a soft voice. It holds out a claw in handshake. \"You guys look friendly though.\"<br>\"Nice to meet ya, Cory!\" Mint says, shaking his small claw. \"OWWIE!!\"<br>Mint grabs his own tentacle and rubs it. \"You pinched me‚Ä¶\"",
        "\"Ah! S-Sowwy‚Ä¶\" Cory apologises. He sighs at his tiny but sharp claws. \"I-I do that a lot, I'm sowwy‚Ä¶\"<br>\"It-it's fine.\" Mint turns to Pinky. \"I know he isn't the snail you were looking for, but‚Ä¶I thought crabs <i>didn't</i> have shells‚Ä¶\"<br>\"It's 'cause I'm a <i>hermit crab</i>, duhh!\" Cory says, crawling towards them. \"I like small homes that I can bring wherever I go!\"<br>\"Wait, that's your <i>home</i>?!\" Pinky gasps.<br>She looked at him with sad eyes. \"I'm sowwy I picked it up earlier‚Ä¶I didn't know‚Äî\"<br>\"It's okay, really,\" Cory responds.<br>His eyes widen and he crawls away from the octopi.",
        "Both octopi glance at one another in confusion.<br>\"It's perfect!\" Cory exclaims, gently touching an empty shell. It's slightly larger than his current shell. He wiggles in his shell and suddenly pops off of it. The rest of his body is exposed, which is in the shape of a spiral like his original shell.<br>\"Ahh! Are you okay?!\" Pinky panics.<br>\"Huh? What do you mean?\" Cory tilts his head in confusion.<br>\"I'm just getting myself a new shell.\"<br>He backs his tail into the new shell, which is shaped like a wide cone. The rest of Cory's body is now hidden inside, and he tucks into the shell even more.<br>\"If I fits, I sits,\" he says calmly.",
        "\"Huh? I thought you guys made your own shells‚Ä¶\" Mint says. \"So you use shells made by snails. Right?\"<br>He gently picks up Cory with two tentacles. The crab's limbs don't move at all and little bubbles sprout from Cory's mouth.<br>\"Oh, he fell asleep‚Ä¶\" Mint sighs.

        "<b>Hermit Crab Facts</b><br>‚Ä¢ Hermit crabs molt, which is when they shed their exoskeleton (outer shell-like body). They do this because their exoskeleton doesn't grow.<br>‚Ä¢ Hermit crabs change shells every year or so, and it usually molts when it does.<br>‚Ä¢ Hermit crabs live in all kinds of sea shells. They use shells made by other creatues like snails. Sadly, hundreds of thousands die because they mistake plastic for shells.<br>‚Ä¢ Hermit crabs are very social, meaning they like to interact with other hermit crabs as well as other sea creatures.",

        "Pinky and Mint are swimming near the deep parts of the ocean. They are octopi. Pinky becomes very interested in a tiny shrimp.<br>\"Wow it's a shrimp‚Ä¶\" she stares. It quickly swims away from fear.<br>\"Huh? Where?\" Mint looks around and his eyes widen.<br>\"It left already‚Äî\" Pinky says.<br>A huge red cloud rushes towards them!<br>\"WAAAAAAAAAHH!!!\" they scream, whirling under water as the cloud hit them. They closed their eyes and could feel little things tickling them. Mint opens his eyes a little and sees millions of the tiny shrimps!<br>\"Wait, Pinky!\" he taps her tentacle and points. \"Those are all wittle shrimps!!\"<br>Pinky slowly opens her eyes and gasps. \"Whoaaa!\"",
        "The huge group of shrimps move like a red tornado. Each of them look scared. One slows down in front of Mint.<br>\"Wun while you stiw can!!\" it says and quickly swims off.<br>\"Run? But why?\" Mint shakes his head in confusion. After a moment the big cloud of shrimps move past them.<br>\"Phew,\" Pinky scratches her head. \"What was that all about?\"<br>Mint and Pinky hear a loud humming noise. It's a little high pitched but sounds sad.<br>\"Is someone singing?\" Mint swims a little bit upwards. He stops when he notices a small dark shape coming towards them.<br>Pinky moves towards it. \"Hiiii!!\" She waves a tentacle.<br>The shape grew bigger as it came closer.",
        "\"Hey, why won't you wave back?\" Pinky frowns.<br>The song coming from the shadow only gets louder. They stare at it and they see it has huge fins. The shape begins to look more like a fish as it comes nearer, only a hundred times bigger than them!<br>\"AAAAAAAH!! SHARKK!!!\" Pinky hides behind Mint in panic. The giant creature's huge mouth opens and reveals hundreds of long teeth.<br>\"WAAAAAAA!!\" Both octopi rush to the side and dodge the hundred-foot long animal. It swims quickly towards the big shrimp cloud, but the shrimps separate and the creature slows down.<br>The octopi hide behind a rock.<br>\"W-W-W-What was <i>that</i>?!\" Pinky stutters.<br>\"Dunno. But we gotta stay quiet!\"",
        "\"W-W-What if it f-finds us‚Ä¶?\"<br>\"I'm sure that's not gonna‚Äî\"<br>A giant head appears above the rock. Pinky and Mint stare at the creature unable to move. It grins.<br>\"Haii theree~!\" the giant says in a slow voice.<br>Pinky doesn't move. Mint blinks. \"H-Hi‚Ä¶\"",
