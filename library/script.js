Books should be read from left to right, top to bottom. To open a book, click on any button under a book genre (<span style='font-family: M PLUS ROUNDED 1C'>&#9888</span> clicking on a book while one is already open will \"override\" your currently open book <span style='font-family: M PLUS ROUNDED 1C'>&#9888</span>). Each book is sorted into a category/genre (e.g. click on Nunnerology under Non-Fiction). Books with \"Vol. 1\", \"Vol. 2\", etc under the title means that book is part of a series. If you're going to start a book series, you should always read each book in order (start with Volume 1, then read Volume 2‚Ä¶) so you understand the storyline.",
        "The Reading Level on the cover shows the \"difficulty\" of the currently open book. It's out of 5 stars, <star>‚òÖ‚òÜ‚òÜ‚òÜ‚òÜ</star> means the book is very easy to read while <star>‚òÖ‚òÖ‚òÖ‚òÖ‚òÖ</star> means the book may be pretty difficult to read (because of the vocabulary). Don't worry if you like reading books 2-stars or less or 4-stars or more, everyone has their likes and dislikes. Most books have a reading level of <star>‚òÖ‚òÖ‚òÖ‚òÜ‚òÜ</star> (moderate level). The book will open up above all the book buttons along will three different buttons. The <span style='font-family: M PLUS ROUNDED 1C'>‚Üê</span> button flips the book one page backward.

        "Pinky and Mint are swimming in the ocean. They are octopi. Mint turns around and sees a strange thing on the ocean floor.<br>\"Ooh, what's that?\" he says, swimming towards it. Pinky floats next to him.<br>\"Wow, that looks cool!\" she exclaims. \"Wait, what is it?\"<br>The strange object is shaped like long, purple tubes.<br>\"Maybe‚Ä¶it's an animal?\" Mint guesses. Using one tentacle, he touches the bumpy outside, but nothing happens. Pinky looks at the thing upside down.<br>\"It didn't move, so it's not an animal‚Ä¶\" Mint says.<br>\"Maybe it's a plant,\" Pinky says. \"Can I eat it?\"<br>\"Umm, I don't think you should,\" Mint warns.",
        "He looks inside the tubes from the top. All them are empty. They both circle it many times while thinking.<br>\"It looks like it's stuck to the ground,\" Pinky says. \"Wait, what's <i>this</i>?\"<br>She stops and looks at another strange thing nearby. It's yellow and has branches. Bumps cover the entire thing.<br>\"These look so cool,\" Mint thinks out loud. \"Are they similar?\"<br>\"Where do the roots of the plant go‚Ä¶?\" Pinky says. She tries to pull the yellow thing out. A branch came off easily when Pinky did, and they watched as it fell onto the ground. \"Uh oh‚Ä¶I broke it‚Ä¶\"<br>\"AAH! What if that was a living thing?!\" Mint says in a panic. \"You broke off it's arm!!\"",
        "A small teal fish swims by and looks at the octopi.<br>\"NOO!!\" she cries in a shrilly voice. \"Look what you've done to my pwecious home‚Ä¶\"<br>The fish races to the yellow thing and sighs.<br>\"I-I'm so sowwy, i-it was an accident,\" Pinky stammers.<br>\"Huh? You don't need to be sorry,\" she smiles. Pinky and Mint look completely confused.<br>\"I should thank you. I've always wanted more of it. Anyway, who <i>are</i> you two?\"<br>\"I'm Mint, and she's Pinky,\" Mint says. He tilts his head a little. \"What do you mean by <i>it</i>?\"<br>\"You know, the <i>coral</i>,\" the fish says, swimming into a purple tube. She sticks her head out of it. \"This is my home, in the <i>coral</i> reef.\"",
        "\"Ohhhh,\" Pinky realizes. \"So <i>coral</i> is the name of these things.\"<br>\"So you live in the coral,\" Mint says. \"They really are plants.\"<br>\"No, they aren't,\" the fish says. Pinky's eyes widen. She turned to the yellow branch-like coral<br>\"I'm sowwy, little guy‚Ä¶\" she says. \"Uhh, where's their eyes?\"<br>\"Well, coral aren't fish either,\" says the little fish. \"But they are alive. Oh, did you see the piece that broke off?\"<br>She swims to the broken coral piece on the ground. It stands upright like a tiny cone, while earlier it didn't. \"These yellow ones are called staghorn coral. Look, it's already growing.\"<br>\"Woah‚Ä¶do they multiply that way?\" Mint asks.<br>\"Pretty much!\" the fish says.",
        "\"I've wanted another Staghorn by my home for a while since they've got many branches.\"<br>\"What's this one then?\" Pinky asks, floating beside the purple tube-like coral.<br>\"Those are tube coral,\" she explains.<br>\"I'm hungry. We should really go now‚Ä¶\" Mint says.<br>\"See you again someday! Bye-byeee!!\" Pinky waves a tentacle at the fish.<br>\"Oh, and my name's Liva! Bye!\"<br>Mint and Pinky swim away from the corals, only to see hundreds of more coral below a small cliff in all different colors.<br>\"Wanna go exploring first?\" Mint smiles at Pinky.<br>\"Race ya to that big rock!\" she called, rushing ahead.",
        "\"W-wait for me! Pinkyyyyy!!!!\" Mint exclaimed, swimming after her.<br><br>The adventures of the two octopi continues!<br><br><b>Coral Facts:</b><br>‚Ä¢ Corals are not plants!

From across the room, three girls pointed at Hope, who was wearing a white and brown tutu.<br>\"What is she even wearing?\" a black-haired girl smirked.<br>\"You're asking me?\" a girl beside her with green & blue hair sniggered. \"It looks like she got that from the dollar store!\"<br>\"Come on, that's mean,\" a blonde-haired girl by them said. \"She at least spent two dollars on that thing she calls an outfit.\"<br>All three girls laughed to themselves.<br>The ballet instructor walked up to Hope. \"Hope, what's the",

        "He mopped the floor, cooked the food, and cleaned the tables.<br>\"Hello?\" a woman sitting in a booth called. \"My burger has onions in it. I specifically asked for no onions.\"<br>\"I apologise,\" Hope's dad responded. \"I'll get you a new one right away.\"<br>He sighed as he finished preparing the burger. Later in the night, he checked out groceries for a customer in a store.

He continued, but was interrupted.<br>\"Stay where you are,\" a man behind him said. He wore a beanie and goggles, holding a gun pointed directly at Richard. Hope's dad turned around.<br>\"Look, I-I don't want any trouble,\" he told the gunman.<br>\"You aren't going to get any,\" the gunman threatened. \"As long as you give me what I want.\"<br>Tears welled up in his eyes as Hope's dad handed him a few dollar bills.<br>\"You're joking, right?\" the gunman said.",
        "\"It's all I have,\" Richard looked down at the floor. \"I work at a diner, I have a child‚Ä¶I don't have much‚Ä¶\"<br>\"Boohoo, cry me a river. There's an ATM <i>right there</i>,\" the gunman said, his gun still pointed at him. \"Take out some money or I'll put a bullet through your head.\"<br>\"I barely have any money in my account. I have <i>nothing</i>‚Ä¶\" he said. The gunman shoved him, but Richard punched him in the face and knocked him over. The gun fell out of his hands, and Richard quickly grabbed it.

Why did you name me Hope?\" she had asked.<br>\"Well,\" he responded. \"Your mom left us really early.\"<br>It had hurt him to recall the pain Hope's mom had gone through.

        "Pinky and Mint swim along the ocean floor. They are octopi. Mint quickly picks up a sea shell on the floor but doesn't find anything inside.<br>\"Haahhhh‚Ä¶\" he sighs. \"All I see are empty shells and rocks. Didn't you say there's snails in these shells?\"<br>\"Hold on, we'll find one somewhere around here‚Ä¶\" Pinky says hopefully. \"We just gotta look harder!\"<br>As they continued their search, Pinky finds a round shell and sees something in it that catches her eye.<br>\"Mint! I found it!!\" she calls.<br>Mint drops the rock he held and swims towards Pinky with excitement.<br>\"Wow‚Ä¶what is it?\"",
        "The red little creature inside the shell doesn't move.<br>\"See? I told you we'd find one!\" Pinky says happily.<br>\"But‚Ä¶what <i>is</i> that?\"<br>\"Uh, it's <i>obviously</i> a <i>snail</i>!\"<br>\"How am I supposed to know?\"<br>The creature twitches as Pinky scoops it into her arms. As they look more closely, it's body looks scaly and dotted with hairs.<br>\"Pfff!\" Mint laughs. \"That's not a snail! That thing's not slimy <i>or</i> squishy!\"<br>\"O-Of course it's a snail!\" Pinky says. She looks down at the shelled creature in her arms. \"Hey there little guy‚Ä¶\"<br>The living thing wiggles as Pinky touches it gently. Both octopi gasp as they realize its \"body\" is actually the creature's legs!",
        "\"WAAUGHH!\" Pinky screams. \"Th-that's NOT a snail‚Äî\"<br>She lets go of the shell and the creature sinks down from her arms onto the floor. Little eyes slowly poke out from the shell and extends its legs.<br>\"Whew‚Ä¶\" the red creature says, shaking sand off of it's body. It looks at the octopi and jumps. \"Yikes!\"<br>The creature quickly digs into the sand to hide, but its shell is still visible.<br>\"Hey, wait!\" Mint cries. He moves a little closer to the frightened creature. \"Umm‚Ä¶lil' crab, we're not here to harm you‚Ä¶\"<br>\"Eek!\" the crab curls up even more into its shell. \"G-Go away‚Ä¶\"<br>\"Hmmm‚Ä¶how do we get them to <i>not</i> be scared‚Ä¶?\" Pinky wonders.",
        "\"Wait, I think I know!\" Mint's eyes light up as he grabs a handful of seaweed and places it in front of the crab. \"Here.\"<br>Moments later, tiny eyes pop out from the shell and stares directly at the seaweed, then to Mint, then to Pinky. Two large claws quickly snatch the seaweed, and the crab munches away at it. It keeps a close eye on the octopi but happily continues to eat.<br>Mint smiles and Pinky does a flip. \"Yippeee!\" Pinky exclaims. She stops and rushes towards the crab. \"Ooh, wait, what's your name, little crabby guy?\"<br>\"Kmmhy,\" The crab mumbles, continues to eat.<br>\"Ummm‚Ä¶what did you say?\" Pinky frowns.",
        "Mint and Pinky watch the little guy eat quietly. After a while, it takes its last bite and swallows. \"Yummy‚Ä¶\" the creature smiles happily. It glances at the two octopi looming over it. \"Oh yeah.\"<br>The crab stands up and stretches, shaking off the sand on its shell. It looks at them with bright eyes. \"My name's Cory. I thought you guys were gonna hurt me or something at first,\" the crab says in a soft voice. It holds out a claw in handshake. \"You guys look friendly though.\"<br>\"Nice to meet ya, Cory!\" Mint says, shaking his small claw. \"OWWIE!!\"<br>Mint grabs his own tentacle and rubs it. \"You pinched me‚Ä¶\"",
        "\"Ah! S-Sowwy‚Ä¶\" Cory apologises. He sighs at his tiny but sharp claws. \"I-I do that a lot, I'm sowwy‚Ä¶\"<br>\"It-it's fine.\" Mint turns to Pinky. \"I know he isn't the snail you were looking for, but‚Ä¶I thought crabs <i>didn't</i> have shells‚Ä¶\"<br>\"It's 'cause I'm a <i>hermit crab</i>, duhh!\" Cory says, crawling towards them. \"I like small homes that I can bring wherever I go!\"<br>\"Wait, that's your <i>home</i>?!\" Pinky gasps.<br>She looked at him with sad eyes. \"I'm sowwy I picked it up earlier‚Ä¶I didn't know‚Äî\"<br>\"It's okay, really,\" Cory responds.<br>His eyes widen and he crawls away from the octopi.",
        "Both octopi glance at one another in confusion.<br>\"It's perfect!\" Cory exclaims, gently touching an empty shell. It's slightly larger than his current shell. He wiggles in his shell and suddenly pops off of it. The rest of his body is exposed, which is in the shape of a spiral like his original shell.<br>\"Ahh! Are you okay?!\" Pinky panics.<br>\"Huh? What do you mean?\" Cory tilts his head in confusion.<br>\"I'm just getting myself a new shell.\"<br>He backs his tail into the new shell, which is shaped like a wide cone. The rest of Cory's body is now hidden inside, and he tucks into the shell even more.<br>\"If I fits, I sits,\" he says calmly.",
        "\"Huh? I thought you guys made your own shells‚Ä¶\" Mint says. \"So you use shells made by snails. Right?\"<br>He gently picks up Cory with two tentacles. The crab's limbs don't move at all and little bubbles sprout from Cory's mouth.<br>\"Oh, he fell asleep‚Ä¶\" Mint sighs. He places him down next to other shells that seem to be sleeping hermit crabs.<br>\"I didn't know there were more crabs.\" Mint says, turning to Pinky. \"So, what now?\"<br>\"Hmmmm‚Ä¶maybe we can go look for the <i>actual</i>snail,\" Pinky says. \"The one I found was <i>really</i> big and had a green shell\"<br>\"Whaaaat!! I think you're making stuff up now‚Ä¶\"<br>\"I'm not! It was so pretty, you should see it!\"",
        "\"How am I supposed to see it if we don't start looking?\"<br>\"‚Ä¶Oh yeah.\" Pinky says. She waves at Cory. \"Good niiight‚Ä¶\"<br>Mint and Pinky swim away, lifting up rocks and shells.<br><br>The adventure of the two octopi continues!<br><br><b>Hermit Crab Facts</b><br>‚Ä¢ Hermit crabs molt, which is when they shed their exoskeleton (outer shell-like body).
