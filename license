nooooo not a NunnerVerse Terms Of Service!!

1. no steal pls
Okay, the NunnerVerse is technically open source, but please don't steal my stuff for profit or something. Just because it's not copyrighted doesn't mean you can steal it!! (pls i am human too)

I'm not making this site for profit myself. So please don't.
You aren't allowed to claim any NunnerLibrary stories that someone else wrote as your own. There is evidence of its existence before yours, anyway.
On the flip side, I'm fine if you use the art though; but for the art galleries, ask the owner for permission first. Fan art is of course also allowed. So yes, you can get a tattoo of the NunnerVerse or paint your shoes with the logo.

2. i don't steal your stuff
Whenever you use the notepad or Drawing Tool, there is absolutely no record of whatever you inputted stored in some sort of database I can access. Your data saves locally, but like there isn't any way for me to use server-sided data (help i don't even know how to do that in the first place—). I could get into the details, but most people would fall asleep if I tried to explain. Long story short, you could put sensitive info in the notepad if you really wanted to (I don't recommend it though, this is still the Internet we're talking about).

hey hey u no steal my stuff, i no steal ur stuff. Capiche?

3. btw we use cookies
It's mostly only for site data like progress in Web Chef or Refractory. I kinda forgot I use Google Analytics (I rarely view it), so umm hopefully you're fine with that. Of course you can opt-out (if you go to the homepage for the first time/clear your cookies). No no, I don't do anything weird with the info though (besides like "huh looks like a guy from [country] visited my site lol"). I used to look at it to see how popular my website was…which was not at all popular at the time.
