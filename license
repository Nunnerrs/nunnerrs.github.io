nooooo not a NunnerVerse Terms Of Service!!

1. no steal pls
ok the NunnerVerse is technically open source but pls don't steal my stuff for profit or something. just because it's not copyrighted doesn't mean you can steal!! (pls i am human too)

i'm not making this site for profit myself. so please don't.
you aren't allowed to claim any NunnerLibrary stories that someone else wrote as your own. there is evidence of its existence before yours, anyway.
you can use the art tho :D (i guess the rock assets too but it's not like you can really view it). fan art is of course also allowed. yes, you can get a tattoo of the NunnerVerse or paint your shoes with the logo.


2. i don't steal your stuff
whenever you use the notepad or Drawing Tool, there is absolutely no record of whatever you inputted stored in some sort of database. your data saves locally, but like there isn't any way for me to use server-sided data (help i don't even know how to do that in the first place). i could get into the details, but most people would fall asleep if i tried to explain.

hey hey u no steal my stuff, i no steal ur stuff. capiche?


3. btw we use cookies
it's mostly only for site data like progress in Web Chef or Refractory. but i kinda forgot i use Google Analytics (i rarely view it) so umm hopefully you're fine with that. no no i don't do anything weird with the info tho (besides like "huh looks like a guy from [country] visited my site lol"). so if you're like "aaaa i hate google" i added an option to opt out of the analytics thing.




sorry if you expected me to yap in an incredulously fancy manner or START SCREAMING AT YOU. this is a one-of-a-kind license.
