To-Do:
• Make buttons work in Lending A Hand
• Add project images to homepage
• Survey for feedback on website
• Somehow prevent being able to cheat using the console
• I should actually use this to-do list
• Venture outside and touch grass
• Extra buttons in notepad for more customization (e.g. font size/family)

• Add "?book=4" to the end of NunnerLibrary link at the bottom of Skylar's Art Gallery
• Add 2-3 <br>'s above Hope Vol. 2 heading

Ideas (tell me if you actually want to see these added):
• Username that can be used in multiple projects (lending a hand)
• Nunners Art Gallery (idk why I don't have one)
• Library page numbers?!?
• Reformat the to-do list (using HTML instead of plain text)
