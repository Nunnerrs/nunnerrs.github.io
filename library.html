Using one tentacle, he touches the bumpy outside, but nothing happens. Pinky looks at the thing upside down.<br>\"It didn't move, so it's not an animal…\" Mint says.<br>\"Maybe it's a plant,\" Pinky says. \"Can I eat it?\"<br>\"Umm, I don't think you should,\" Mint warns.",

It's yellow and has branches. Bumps cover the entire thing.<br>\"These look so cool,\" Mint thinks out loud. \"Are they similar?\"<br>\"Where do the roots of the plant go…?\" Pinky says. She tries to pull the yellow thing out. A branch came off easily when Pinky did, and they watched as it fell onto the ground. \"Uh oh…I broke it…\"<br>\"AAH! What if that was a living thing?!\" Mint says in a panic. \"You broke off it's arm!!\"",

He tilts his head a little. \"What do you mean by <i>it</i>?\"<br>\"You know, the <i>coral</i>,\" the fish says, swimming into a purple tube. She sticks her head out of it. \"This is my home, in the <i>coral</i> reef.\"",

Pinky's eyes widen. She turned to the yellow branch-like coral<br>\"I'm sowwy, little guy…\" she says. \"Uhh, where's their eyes?\"<br>\"Well, coral aren't fish either,\" says the little fish. \"But they are alive. Oh, did you see the piece that broke off?\"<br>She swims to the coral fragment on the ground. It stands upright like a tiny cone, while earlier it didn't. \"These yellow ones are called Staghorn coral. Look, it's already beginning to grow.\"<br>\"Woah…do they multiply that way?\" Mint asks.<br>\"Pretty much!\" the fish says.",

We should really go now…\" Mint says.<br>\"See you again someday! Bye-byeee!!\" Pinky waves a tentacle at the fish.<br>\"Oh, and my name's Liva! Bye!\"<br>Mint and Pinky swim away from the corals, only to see hundreds of more coral below a small cliff in all different colors.<br>\"Wanna go exploring first?\" Mint smiles at Pinky.<br>\"Race ya to that big rock!\" she called, rushing ahead.",

Every seat in the audience was full. The ballerinas danced gracefully along with the music. Hope ran across the stage and leaped. She led the others in pointe at the center. Hope's dad sat in the front row, tears of joy in his eyes. Hope twirled in the center as the ballet performance came to a close.

I specifically asked for no onions.\"<br>\"I apologize,\" Hope's dad responded. \"I'll get you a new one right away.\"<br>He sighed as he finished preparing the burger. Later in the night, he checked out groceries for a customer in a store. He swept the floor and cleaned the isles too.<br>\"Richard, could I talk to you in my office?\" the manager said as he came up to him.<br>\"Yes, of course.\" he replied.<br>They entered the office, and the manager sat down.",
                    "\"Well, you've been coming late to work recently,\" he began. \"And you've been slacking in your work performance. What's been going on?\"<br>\"I have a daughter. I need to take care of her.\" Richard explained. \"Plus, I have another job.\"<br>\"I think you're taking on more than you can handle,\" the manager said calmly. \"So, I am with no other choice but to relieve you from this job. You've been a brilliant employee.\"<br>\"I really need the money, please dont—\"<br>\"I have no other choice.

Her hat was placed upside-down on the floor for donations. A blond-haired boy placed a dollar bill in her hat.<br>\"You're really talented,\" he told her. \"You know that, right?\"<br>\"Oh, thanks…\" Hope blushed.<br>\"Uh, I'm Noah.\"<br>\"Hope.\"<br>\"Pretty name.\" Noah said.<br>\"Yeah, my dad says it's special.\"<br>\"Mhm.\"<br>\"Well, nice meeting you, Noah.

                    "\"See you, stay safe.\" Lucy replied. He went outside and began walking home. He looked around, feeling slighly uncomfortable. He continued, but was interrupted.<br>\"Stay where you are,\" a man behind him said. He wore a beanie and goggles, holding a gun pointed directly at Richard. Hope's dad turned around.<br>\"Look, I-I don't want any trouble,\" he told the gunman.<br>\"You aren't going to get any,\" the gunman threatened. \"As long as you give me what I want.\"<br>Tears welled up in his eyes as Hope's dad handed him a few dollar bills.<br>\"You're joking, right?\" the gunman said.",
                    "\"It's all I have,\" Richard looked down at the floor. \"I work at a diner, I have a child…I don't have much…\"<br>\"Boohoo, cry me a river. There's an ATM <i>right there</i>,\" the gunman said, his gun still pointed at him. \"Take out some money or I'll put a bullet through your head.\"<br>\"I barely have any money in my account. I have <i>nothing</i>…\" he said. The gunman shoved him, but Richard punched him in the face and knocked him over. The gun fell out of his hands, and Richard quickly grabbed it. He pointed it at his attacker.<br>\"I know you won't do it,\" the gunman smirked. A gun went off loudly, but it wasn't the one Richard held. Hope's dad looked down at his chest, and fell to his knees.",

                    "\"Yes, sir?

                    "No response. The smile on her dad's face faded away.<br>\"No…\" Hope muttered. The sound from the monitor beeped without pausing.
